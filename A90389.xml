         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YE little think how dear ye are unto me becauſe of your breakings (ſuch of you as have been broken by power and not by notion.) That which I have felt in the ſame kind (for I have been broken all in peeces once and again, yea and yet again; My life and my ſtrength hath been led, nay driven into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, yea I have been made to taſte the death of the whole lump, and the death of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel over and over, and the bitter reliſh of it is yet very ſtrong upon my palate) That, I ſay, which I have felt in this kind, hath made me beyond meaſure tender towards you, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but own you before all the world as the greateſt objects both of my delight and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I am moſt pleaſed in beholding you; your ſickneſs is more lovely in my eye then that health which others enjoy and pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in; My expectations, of the next diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:165768:3"/>
of Light, Life and Glory, are faſtned upon you, as the moſt proper materials which wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath fitted to diſcloſe it ſelf in moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly to the world. My heart tells me that ye are not thus ſhattered, broken, and made ſo odious for nothing: yet let me withal tell you, that my ſpirit thinketh you never the neerer either for your principles or practiſes, which carry more unlovelineſs to me then any principles or practiſes of any ſort of men upon the face of the earth. It is not your new Fabrick but your old deſolations that kindle in me any deſire towards you or hopes concerning you. They are not your new notions of God, Chriſt, the death of Chriſt, the life of Chriſt, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, the Judgment, hell, heaven, the equality of things, the community of things, &amp;c. that repreſent you any thing lovely to me; No really, My palate doth in no wiſe reliſh this new wine, but rather ſaith the old is better. But 'tis your broken ſtate, your deſolate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, your being ſtripped and made naked of all your garments, ornaments, beauty, glory: this is it takes with me; and if I could ſee you yet more ſick, yet more ſtripped, ſtripped of theſe new fig-leaves alſo wherewith you cover your
<pb facs="tcp:165768:3"/>
old nakedneſs, mine eye would more pity you and my heart more love and embrace you. As ye live, I loath you; nay I loath your life more then the life of any elſe: So far as ye are dead I cannot but hug you.</p>
            <p>And for ſuch of you who break forth through Viſions and Revelations into new apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I profeſs I know you not, this is not the way of the breaking forth of my life, which muſt not be ſteered by theſe, but be able to judg theſe, which when once I feel with cleerneſs, Majeſty and power, I may then be drawn to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that I begin to taſte life.</p>
            <p>But oh how I long to ſee your new life, with all the motions of it ſwallowed up by death! There is a cup prepared for you, a baptiſm ye are to be baptized with, which ſhall waſh you clean within, and make you vomit luſtily, even till ye are quite emptied of all that froth and ſcum of vanity, which now ſwims up and down in your ſtomacks, and fumes up into your brains.</p>
            <p>This is not HE, whom ye now hold forth. This is not God, nor any thing, which ye now take to be all things. The child is not yet born in you that knows how to chuſe the good or
<pb facs="tcp:165768:4"/>
refuſe the evill. This is not the Land of promiſe wherein ye now ſet up your reſt, but a ſtrange land, a land of dearth and barrenneſs, a land of darkneſs and of the ſhadow of death. This is not light, not true light; it is but a painted light wherein ye now walk: not the light of the Lord, but the light of the vain imagination of the creature. O quit your ſtation, your preſent habitation, the wilderneſs is better, though not as an abode, yet as a paſſage. Depart ye, depart ye; this is not your reſt: for it is polluted. Life lives not here. This is not the chamber of the Bridegroom for him to embrace and enjoy his Bride in. This is poor gain, This falls ſhort of what ye have loſt. The meaneſt enjoyment of a living God in the loweſt diſpenſation, is better then the higheſt tranſportations from airy notions.</p>
            <p>O my Beloved, where dwelleſt thou! where is thy Temple, where is thy Turtle! where dwelleſt thou, where dwells thy love! Where ſhal God and his people meet to know and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy one another! When ſhal the Son put off his ſervile Form, and be admitted into his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance! When ſhall the creature be made free, which hath ſo long groaned under the bondage
<pb facs="tcp:165768:4"/>
of its corruption! Awake, ariſe, ſave with thy right hand, that thy Beloved may be delivered. Gather into thy ſelf that which cannot be happy out of thee. Put an end to death to deſtruction, by thy life, by thy Salvation. Bind up enmity in the boſom of thine own love. O let us at length ſee the conqueſt of love. Overcome all by thine own goodneſs. Swallow up all in thine own perfection, and nothing ſhall remain weak or imperfect any longer. Viſit thy faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spouſe; for behold the very ſtrength of her heart faileth, which ſhe deſireth only to preſerve to entertain and embrace thee with: Her ſpirit is quite ſpent, therefore contend no longer, but yeild up thy ſelf at length to the deſire, which thou thy ſelf haſt kindled in the boſom of thy Beloved. Revive that precious life by thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence which is expiring for want of thee, and can no longer live but in thee and with thee. Thou who haſt prepared food for every thing thou haſte made, ſatisfie that hunger, that thirſt which is immeaſurable after, and can only be allayed with the preſence and poſſeſſion of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God. Thou who inviteſt him that is a thirſt, give to him whoſe very tongue faileth for thirſt, that he may drink of the water of life freely and
<pb facs="tcp:165768:5"/>
fully. What ſhall every deſire be ſatisfied, but that which is kindled after God? Is this the true way, the only way to reſtleſneſs and miſery, to be touched and inflamed with love towards God? Is there no cure for this love, no raſing it out of the heart, nor no attracting its object into the heart? O God why art thou ſo coy? why doſt thou ſo diſdain the low eſtate of thy Spouſe? What credit will it be unto thee to have it ſaid and ſeen, when all things ſhall be opened to all eyes and ſpoken in all eares, Behold a Soul burnt up into perfect miſery by the flames of its own love!</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Difference between God and the Creature, can only be ſeen by that eye, which throughly diſcerneth, and is able to meaſure both throughout: yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that meaſure we have to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ſomewhat of both, we may alſo in part diſcern that vaſt difference that is between them.</p>
            <p>God is the <hi>Original Being,</hi> the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but a <hi>derived Being,</hi> and hath only ſo much of and from God, as he is pleaſed to impart unto it, <hi>who may do what he will with his own,</hi> diſpenſing it as he pleaſeth. As every thing is a ſhadow of him; ſo every thing hath ſome ſtamp of his Image upon it; one ſort of creatures more then another, Man more then other ſorts, ſome ſorts of men more then others. Man is a God in reſpect of the creatures, yet ſtill he is but man, <hi>the Egyptians are men, and not God;</hi> Some men are Gods in reſpect of others, in reference to that <hi>majeſty, wiſdom, justice, mercy, kindneſs, love, holineſs, &amp;c.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſome are endued beyond others.</p>
            <p>Man in his beſt eſtate is vanity; weak, fading, changeable; his very ſoul and ſpirit ſubject to faint, and unable to ſtand before the hand of God, when it goeth forth againſt him: <hi>Who knoweth the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:165768:6"/>
Power of thine anger! I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth, lest the ſpirit ſhould fail before me, and the Souls which I have made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Man came from God, his ſpirit was made, ſo was not Gods. God is able to bear his own weight in every kind, Man is not able to bear his weight in any kind. God can ſo wound the ſtrongeſt man as quickly to make him ſink; <hi>A wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> But God can not only bear up himſelf, but man alſo under the greateſt preſſure.</p>
            <p>Man is a poor, narrow, confined, limited ſpirit: God is a large, univerſal, unlimited Spirit; <hi>He ſitteth upon the Circle of the Earth.</hi> God is Subſtance, Truth: Man is vanity <hi>(in his beſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate altogether vanity)</hi> a ſhadow in himſelf, in all his motions, <hi>(man walketh in a vain ſhade)</hi> a lye, a lyar, <hi>(let God be true, and every man a lyar.)</hi> All men, put them in the ballance, they are nothing before God, but <hi>as the dust of the ballance,</hi> as <hi>graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, as nothing, leſs then nothing, and vanity.</hi> All that all the men in the Earth have derivatively from him, is nothing to that which is originally in him; <hi>Whereunto will ye liken me, ſaith the moſt High?</hi> There is nothing throughout the whole Creation, nothing that man can ſee, nothing that can enter into his heart or thoughts, that can bear any true or ſubſtantial reſemblance of God. Alas, poor man, what canſt thou think aright concerning God! Wilt thou be meaſuring God, what he is, or what his Thoughts, or what his Ways in any kind, are? <hi>Who knoweth the Spirit of the Lord?</hi> O Man, thou haſt ever been befooled in all thy thoughts of God; and as thou riſeſt higher in thy apprehenſions, and bolder in thy determinations, the more ſhalt thou certainly be befooled. When God openeth himſelf, to thy coſt ſhalt thou ſee, how far thou waſt from knowing him, or ſpeaking aright concerning him.</p>

            <head>Of Good and Evil.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>GOOD</hi> is that which tends to the welfare of the creature: <hi>Evil</hi> is that which tends to its hurt and damage. They have alſo ſome reference to God, though not as he is in himſelf, yet as he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth himſelf, appeareth, and acteth in ſuch or ſuch a line: So in the ſeveral lines, wherein he acts, there is a Good and an Evil, the one tending towards his honour in that line, the other towards his diſhonour.</p>
            <p>God as he is in himſelf cannot be touched, yet as he appeareth, acteth, and holdeth forth his Name, it may receive honour or diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement; <hi>Him that honoureth me, I will honour.</hi> The <hi>Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs, Love, Grace, Mercy</hi> of God, &amp;c. may be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, ſlighted, undervalued by the creature: He may diſcover theſe in his motions, and the creature not take notice of them, not acknowledg them, not acknowledg him in them; and this is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour caſt upon him. Again; They may be taken notice of, and he exalted in the thoughts and heart of the creature thereby; and this he pleaſeth to accept of and eſteem as an honour done unto him.</p>
            <p>Now there is a double kind of good. The creature's keeping in its line, walking to its rule, moving orderly in its ſtation; and the enjoying of life, ſweetneſs and content therein. The living to God, and the enjoying of God, in its courſe, in its Orb, in its ſphere, this is good, and herein lieth the happineſs of the creature.</p>
            <p>There is anſwerably a double Evil. The creature's deviating from its line, walking out of its way, ſwerving from the rule of its Creation; and its meeting with that miſery which attends this, loſing its life, ſweetneſs, content, happineſs. And let men think what they will by the change of their apprehenſions, yet Good and Evil will evidence their difference to the ſence and experience of the creature: that they are different in their own nature, are ſown in different grounds, grow from different roots, and tend to different
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:165768:7"/>
ends. And the creature, while it is a creature, cannot be happy in the way of Evil (either in his preſent ſtate, or in his end) but only in the way of Good. <hi>Mark the perfect man, behold the upright; the end of that man is peace. Say ye to the righteous, it ſhall go well with him; Say to the wicked, it ſhall not go well with him. Bleſſed is the man that walketh not in the counſel of the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c. he ſhall be like a tree planted, &amp;c. The ungodly are not ſo, they ſhall not ſtand in judgment, nor ſinners in the Congregation of the Righteous.</hi> Chriſt himſelf, the beloved Son, cometh to his Exaltation by Righteouſneſs; <hi>Becauſe thou loveſt Righteouſneſs, and hateſt iniquity, therefore God even thy God hath anointed thee with the oyl of gladneſs above thy fellows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the righteouſneſs of the creature fall, lay it as flat as ye will, make unrighteouſneſs equal with it, as well ye may, becauſe it is but unrighteouſneſs, and ſomewhat more unlovely, becauſe of its paint. But is there no other Righteouſneſs? Is there no true Righteouſneſs? Or muſt that fare the worſe, becauſe there is ſo much painted righteouſneſs? Conſider this well. All Gods work, from the very beginning, hath been about Righteouſneſs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, holding forth the evil nature of the one, the excellent nature of the other; expreſſing his eſteem of the one, his hatred of the other, ſhewing the different ends of each, &amp;c. Now how will he come off at laſt, if all this ſhould prove nothing but a flam, and one ſhould be as good as the other, and both tend but to one and the ſame end? If it ſhould be granted, that both ſhall be ſwallowed up at laſt, yet doubtleſs there muſt be ſubordinate ends, (which muſt have their time and courſe, and may contain in them a larger <hi>everlasting</hi> or <hi>for ever,</hi> then yet we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with,) wherein their difference ſhall appear, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoſe things ſpoken concerning them in the Scripture muſt be fulfilled.</p>

            <head>Of the Devil.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Devil</hi> is that <hi>created Spirit,</hi> which God hath fitted with <hi>enmity, ſubtilty,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> for the diſtraction and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his Works. God, to ſhew his own <hi>Wiſdom, Strength,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> hath prepared oppoſition againſt himſelf; and that they might appear the more clearly, he hath ſo fitted the Oppoſer, as may beſt try and draw out his own to the utmoſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Devil</hi> is not an <hi>Original Spirit,</hi> no more then the reſt of the creatures; but a created, a derived Spirit. It is <hi>the breath of the Lord in his nostrils</hi> that gives him life: all that he has, and is, came from the Lord, and remains ſtill in the Lord; in whom he lives, and moves, and acts; and who lives, and moves, and acts in him. There is but one, originally; This one is all, and in all: all in every being, all in every motion; all in Heaven, Earth, Hell; all in herbs, plants, beaſts, birds, fiſhes, men, devils; all in every of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Now the work of this Spirit is to deſtroy; to oppoſe God: or if you will, that which God intended to work in, by, and through this created Spirit, was to oppoſe himſelf; to deſtroy his own Works, ſo far as he ſaw good. God made all good; but he did not intend this goodneſs ſhould ſtand, therefore he provides this Spirit to let looſe upon the Creation, to eat out the ſweetneſs, the beauty, the vertue, the excellency of it.</p>
            <p>Now that this Spirit might the better accompliſh his work, he is fitted for it with Enmity, Subtilty, and Strength.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>With Enmity.</hi> Hence he hath his name, <hi>Satan,</hi> an Enemy. An enemy to God, to the creature, to the life and happineſs of both, to all that is good and truly excellent: And where he throughly prevails, he ſows all this enmity, and begets a child like himſelf; <hi>O full of all ſubtilty, and all miſchief, thou child of the Devil, thou enemy of all Righteouſneſs.</hi> We ſee enmity in the creatures one againſt another, this is his work, <hi>from the beginning it was not ſo,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:165768:8"/>
all was in peace and love before <hi>the evil one</hi> ſowed the tares of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. As all ſhall be in peace at laſt <hi>(the Lion and the Lamb ſhall lie down together:)</hi> ſo all was in peace at firſt. This was one part of the goodneſs that God ſaw in his works, namely, the harmony, the ſweetneſs, the natural unity and ſubſerviency, which he beheld in the whole, when it came newly out of his fingers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is fitted <hi>with Subtilty;</hi> not with Wiſdom, that is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Chriſt, he is <hi>the Wiſdom of God.</hi> (As God only is <hi>Love;</hi> ſo God alone is <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> There is a vein of ſubtilty runs through the Devil, and through wicked men, but it is not wiſdom.) That the Devil might the better do his work, he hath abundance of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty as well as enmity (yea all ſubtilty) beſtowed upon him; <hi>O full of all ſubtilty,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> to one who had it but at the ſecond hand, from him, for he was but the child of the Devil. And he is very ſubtle; for though he cannot reach the original Wiſdom of God, nor can he touch any of his Plot, any of his Deſign, which is wrapped up ſafe in it, (but he himſelf is but an engine there:) yet in his ſeveral goings forth, in his footſteps and tracks that appear, he can there undermine him, and daſh his enterpriſes in peeces.</p>
            <p>Thus did he break the whole fabrick of the Creation, which God made an excellent, ſweet, beautiful Peece, what an heap of confuſion, miſery and vanity is it now become? The whole world lieth in him, and the whole world is poyſoned by him, and is become a kind of Devil with him, a peece of enmity, a tormentor of it ſelf: There is nothing in it lives in true love, in true wiſdom, in true peace; but in a deviliſh love and policy. There is ſuch a love and wiſdom in the world, as is in the Devil; ſuch peace and good-will among men, as is in Hell among devils.</p>
            <p>Thus did he break the ſpiritual Fabrick of the New-Creation, <hi>the evil one ſowed tares</hi> in this field alſo. The <hi>Huſbandry, the building of God</hi> was no ſooner erected by God, but it was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defaced by him. He hath taken poſſeſſion of this inward world, and hath emptied all ſorts of Religions of <hi>true love,</hi> and filled them only with <hi>enmity;</hi> and <hi>the wiſdom</hi> that is among them is neither <hi>pure</hi> nor <hi>peaceable</hi> but <hi>ſenſual and deviliſh.</hi> He appeareth <hi>like an Angel of light,</hi> that he may vent his own wares, and his great traffique is in Religion; but for all the paint wherewith he colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, he that can look into them may ſee them to be his wares.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:165768:8"/>
The Devil hath <hi>his faith, his love, his holineſs, his ways of raviſhing and transporting the heart in prayer, in meditation, in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp;c.</hi> It is not the ſweetneſs of theſe, it is not the pleaſingneſs of theſe, it is not the warming and drawing forth of the heart in theſe, that can diſtinguiſh them. There is abundance of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit ſtuff abroad in the world, (the Devil is making uſe of his time, he may be ſomewhat near playing his maſter-peece, though as yet he needeth not to do it) little of truth, becauſe now is the time of deſtruction; God giveth the Devil ſtring, and he will make uſe of it to the utmoſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He is fitted <hi>with Strength.</hi> He is <hi>the ſtrong man armed.</hi> He is ſtrong in himſelf, the world is but a weak thing to him; Man is very weak before him, yea the renewed man hath nothing of ſtrength comparable to him. He is a fountain, a Well-head, a kind of original; ſo vaſt, that he contains all wicked perſons, all wicked actions, all wicked things, all wicked motions, within him. He hath a Kingdom, and is a mighty King; and not a King in title, but he hath the head and heart of a King; he is as fit to be the Head of his Body in his kind, as Chriſt is to be the Head of his Body in his kind. He has ſo much ſtrength in him that no place can be at quiet, can be free from enmity, while he is there, unleſs it will admit of his peace. There will be trouble in Heaven, in Earth, in each, in both, till he be caſt out of both into the pit, and bound up in the pit. There is no chaining of him, but <hi>by eternal, by everlasting Strength.</hi> He dares venture upon any thing even upon Chriſt himſelf; and if God, with his infinite Power and Wiſdom, had not ſtood by him, and ſtuck cloſe to him, he had without doubt vanquiſhed him.</p>
            <p>And he is not only ſtrong, but armed; He hath <hi>his fortreſſes, his bulwarks, his ammunion,</hi> both of offence and defence, in every kind, whereby he can ſet upon his enemy, or ſtrengthen and defend his own, as occaſion ſerves.</p>
            <p>Lo, <hi>this is the great Destroyer,</hi> he that dwells in death, he that leads unto death; and what can be proper for him, but death, but deſtruction? He that hath ſlain the creature, is it not fit he himſelf ſhould dye? <hi>He that hath ſhed the blood of man,</hi> is it not juſt and equal, that <hi>by man his blood ſhould be ſhed?</hi> He that hath marred and deſtroyed the whole Creation, doth he not deſerve his wages? and is it not fit he ſhould be payd in his own coyn, even with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:165768:9"/>
death and deſtruction? And as for ſuch as are led captive by him, whither can they be led, but into death and deſtruction with him? Surely there are none can eſcape from him, or from ſuffering that torment that is cut out for him and his, but <hi>the redeemed of the Lord,</hi> thoſe who by his Power, his Love, his Purchaſe, are fetched out of the claws of this cruel one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But how can God be juſt in puniſhing the Devil, if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to his work, and fitted him for his work? How can the Devil be blameable for acting as he was made, for fulfilling the will of him who made him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Hath not God power to make what he pleaſeth? May he not make uſe of his Power, to ſhew his skill in making ſeveral kinds of things, of ſeveral natures, and appoint them diſtinct courſes and ends according to their natures? May he not make Hell as well as Heaven, darkneſs as well as light, evil as well as good? <hi>(I form the light, and create darkneſs: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all theſe things. The Lord made all things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, even the wicked for the day of wrath.)</hi> If he hath a black ſeed of death and deſtruction, which he ſoweth in ground ſuitable to it, and cauſeth to grow up unto death, unto deſtruction, what haſt thou to ſay to him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O ſhallow man,</hi> when wilt thou ceaſe meaſuring God by the eye of thy Reaſon! Wilt thou ſay it muſt be thus and thus, it cannot be otherwiſe, becauſe thou canſt not ſee how it can be otherwiſe? Thou knoweſt not any one creature throughout the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet thou wilt be taking upon thee to know God.

            <p>
               <hi>RIghteouſneſs</hi> is the conformity of perſons, things, or actions, to a ſtreight Rule. To make perſons, things, or actions righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, there muſt be a Rule, that Rule juſt, and the perſon, thing, or action, conformed to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holineſs</hi> is the purity of any nature. Gods Holineſs is the purity of his Divine Nature, mans holineſs is the purity of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, its conſtitution and current in its own immixed channel. In every thing there is an uncleanneſs, an impurity, and a purity. We ſee this in the nature of bodies, and alſo in the nature of ſpirits, in the conſtitution and actions of both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Happineſs</hi> flows from Righteouſneſs and Holineſs. God cannot but be happy, becauſe he is both righteous and holy: Not as many underſtand, that whatſoever he ſhould do he could not be unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or unholy, but becauſe he cannot but keep within the limits of his own holy and righteous Nature in his motions and actions. <hi>Shall not the Judg of all the Earth do right?</hi> It is not right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth it; but becauſe he is what he is, he cannot but do what is right. And he in whom the ſeed of God is cannot ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot but do ſo likewiſe; he is free only to that to which his own nature inclines him, which is an holy and righteous nature, and can run but in its own channel.</p>
            <p>The Devil is the unclean, the unrighteous one, therefore alſo the miſerable one. He is the fountain of impurity, poyſon in himſelf, and poyſoning every thing he comes near: and ſo long as any thing is within his verge, within his kingdom, it can be neither righteous, holy, nor happy. The ſubjection of the creature at preſent to him, is its vanity, its bondage, its death, its miſery; and it can never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it ſelf, until it be delivered from his dominion, and be purged of that tincture of uncleanneſs which he hath breathed and infuſed into

It requireth no ſmall skill, power and love, to redeem the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and when the miſery of our preſent ſtate appears in its own colours, we ſhall ſee the need of, and know how to prize Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            <p>
               <hi>REdemption</hi> is the buying of the creature out of its captivity, the bringing of it back into its former ſtate, into its conformity unto God, into its union and communion with God. The crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſlipped from God, the creature was gained by the Devils wiles into his poſſeſſion: Redemption is the recovery of the creature by that price which Wiſdom, Power and Love weighed out, and layd down for the reſcue of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He who redeemeth us is God,</hi> he payeth the price for us. He who made us, paying the price of our Creation, redeems us too, paying the price of our Redemption. He who layd out ſo much Wiſdom, Power and Love in forming us, is alſo at the coſt of all the Wiſdom, Power and Love that is requiſite to redeem and renew us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He, whom he redeemeth us by, is his Son;</hi> he doth it <hi>by the blood of his Son.</hi> Wiſdom and Love hath prepared in and by him a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, not to bribe, but juſtly to ſtop the mouth of Juſtice, by paying it its full price.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He, to whom he payeth the price, is himſelf.</hi> He payeth it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and he payeth it to himſelf. His Love payeth the price to his Juſtice. His Juſtice is himſelf, it will not be bribed, but will ſtand upon its right while it hath a Being: his Love doth not go about to undermine it, but to ſatisfie it, by paying the whole price that it requires; and hereby it maketh Juſtice its friend, and as ready to ſeal the diſcharge of the priſoner, as Love can be to deſire it. To
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:165768:10"/>
illuſtrate this a little, becauſe it ſeemeth to ſome ſo impoſſible. Suppoſe a King making a Law of Death, after the manner of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> irreverſible: One, whom he exceedingly loves, tranſgreſſeth this Law: Suppoſe this King could, by his great underſtanding and skill, fairly according to exact Rules of Juſtice, transfer this fault upon his ſon, and ſhould, out of love to the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo do, giving up his own ſon to death for him. Here is the King himſelf, paying the price to himſelf, of the tranſgreſſion of his own Law. And yet God is more exact in the caſe in hand, for with him the ſame perſon, or that which offended in the perſon, dyeth. It was not ſimply a man, but the manhood that ſinned; and he ſent his Son not barely to offer up himſelf, but the Manhood. He ſlew and offered up the man in himſelf, the nature that offended: He gave up that principle of life in himſelf that had gone aſtray in man, not to have it ſpared in the reſt, but to have it offered up in them alſo, ſo that there is no more living henceforth by it, but the life now to be had is a new life after the death of this, (I mean not, the body, but the ſpirit,) which muſt as certainly dye in us, before we live, as Chriſts did. And ſurely this death muſt needs be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, and of true worth and value in his eye, ſeeing by it all dyes that he would not have live. He offereth up his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Life, and puts to death all that is polluted; and all that he deſires is, that he and his may live, after this death, a life that cannot dye, nor be defiled. He would have that Principle of Life live only where it was, and as it was, before it miſcarried in their hand. The great Work of Chriſt is, firſt to bring all forth from God by a weak fading Life, and then to bring all back again to God by a ſtrong vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Death: And as he receiveth life firſt, and ſo communicateth it unto them; ſo he enters into death firſt, he begins the cup of death &amp; deſtruction to them alſo: And as they could not but live, when he let out life upon them; ſo they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but dye, when he adminiſters death unto them. He did not dye that any might eſcape death, but that they might paſs through it to life; that they might be redeemed from death, that they might live again; that was it he gave his life for, and that is the fruit of his death. And it is another-gheſs death we have by Chriſt, and ſuffer with Chriſt, then that which fell upon us from ſin and the Law. By the Law we dye in ſin, we enter into and lie under condemnation: By Chriſt that principle of life dyeth in us that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:165768:11"/>
ſinned; ſo that we can ſin no more, nor be no more obnoxious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, after once we come to live in him. O ſweet Price! O excellent Purchaſe! The Life, which Chriſt hath bought for us, was worth the buying, it is Life indeed: and the Price he gave was of value alſo, both in it ſelf, and in the eyes of him, who could not but accept it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He out of whoſe hands he redeemeth us, is the Devil,</hi> who is the great Lord and Tyrant over us until then, until Redemption be perfected. He doth not pay to him the Price, but to his own Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and then taketh us from him by force; for there is no dealing with him by Juſtice, but only by Power, yet God will ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf juſt in putting forth his Power to recover any thing from him, therefore firſt he clears his right to us, and then tugs with him for us, who unjuſtly detaineth us from him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That which he redeemeth us from,</hi> is that <hi>ſlavery, miſery and vanity,</hi> which we are in ſubjection unto by lying under the Devil, by being in the hands of the Devil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That which he redeemeth us unto, is the enjoyment of himſelf,</hi> of life and bleſſedneſs in himſelf; and the end, the intent he hath in redeeming us is, that he might enjoy us, and that we might be happy in him and with him.</p>

            <head>Of Faith.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>FAith is the divine Instinct of the new Nature in the new Creature, whereby it naturally knoweth, and goeth forth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God as its Center.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faith is not an acquired thing, but ſown in nature; humane Faith in the nature of man, ſpiritual Faith in the nature of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man. Indeed outward occurrences and experiences may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion its growing and thriving, but they cannot ſow the ſeed of it.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:165768:11"/>
Things from without may draw it out, and ſtrengthen it, but not beget it. And yet, to ſpeak properly, they cannot encreaſe it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but rather the ſame life flowing from the Fountain through them into it: And ſo life can at any time reach it, either immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from it ſelf, or through any other conveyance it ſhall pleaſe to chuſe.</p>
            <p>In Faith there are two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The knowledg of God.</hi> Faith, it is the eye wherewith we ſee God and ſpiritual things. We ſee nothing that is ſpiritual by our nature, by our reaſon, but only by Faith. We ſee indeed with thoſe eyes that which we think to be and call the ſame thing, but not that which is the ſame thing. We have a kind of ſight, a natural ſight, a rational ſight, yea a beleeving ſight of theſe things without this Faith, (for there is Faith in nature, and this Faith will act towards every thing that nature, or any revelation or diſcovery to the eye of Nature, can point out as a proper object for it,) but this ſight is not the ſpiritual ſight. This light is but darkneſs, not light; and that ſight, which is in and by this light, is but blindneſs, not ſight. This light cannot comprehend any thing that is ſpiritual, nor can this eye ſee any thing that is ſpiritual. The light is too thick, and the eye is too weak.</p>
            <p>Man hath ever been ſearching after God, making no queſtion but if he were diſcovered once, he could ſee him, not perceiving in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the want of that eye which alone can ſee him, which is <hi>this eye of Faith,</hi> which alone is ſown and grows up in the new nature. And where this Faith is ſown, though there were never any outward means, the knowledg of God could not but ſpring up, for it is ſown in Faith, in the very nature of Faith, and doth as naturally ſpring up and grow, as any thing in the ordinary courſe of common nature doth. The knowledg this child hath of his Parent is by its nature, by feeling the nature of his Parent in him, by the inſtinct of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature in himſelf, which points out God to him as his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is in Faith <hi>a going forth towards God in deſire, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, in confidence:</hi> it naturally deſires God, delights in God, and relieth upon him. This Nature teacheth him more freely and fully to truſt God, then the nature in common children doth them to truſt their parents. It is not by outward promiſes, and falling in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:165768:12"/>
with a viſible Covenant, that things are tranſacted between God and them; but God begetteth them by his nature, and they turn again towards God by the ſame nature, ſo ſoon as it ſprings up and acts in them. <hi>Of his own will</hi> he begets them, and <hi>by the ſame will</hi> begotten in them, they run into his lap, and give themſelves up unto him. The little, weak, imperfect, childiſh Will of eternity in us, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally rouls it ſelf upon the perfect, compleat, fatherly Will of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in God.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Faith is the ſubstance of a Chriſtian,</hi> of this new child. All that the Soul is, it is by Faith: All that the Soul enjoys, it enjoys by Faith: All that the Soul acts, it acts by Faith: All that the Soul receives, it receives by Faith. <hi>By Faith it walks with God; by Faith it pleaſeth God; by Faith it goeth forth towards God; by Faith it receiveth God into it ſelf:</hi> or in plain terms, It is by the ſeveral windings and turnings of this divine Inſtinct, that it lives, moves, acts, enjoys any thing. And as this Inſtinct or nature is nipped, ſo it withers and dyes, for it hath its ſtorms, and ſharp Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter blaſts and froſts, and ſo alſo it hath its ſeaſons of retiring its life, as things in this outward world have.</p>
            <p>By Faith this weak veſſel, whereinto this new Nature is put, comes to be ſaved; for the new man himſelf needeth not Salvation for himſelf, having never ſinned: but the veſſel, whereinto it is put, is unclean, and fit only to be caſt away, unleſs it were purified and ſaved by Faith.</p>

            <head>Of Love.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>LOve is the ſpiritual affection between God and this new child.</hi> As they know one another, ſo they love one another: and as their knowledg is the ſtraiteſt knowledg, ſo is their love likewiſe the cloſeſt love. There is no ſuch union beſides as is between them, nor are there any ſuch ſtreams of love any where elſe to carry
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:165768:12"/>
hearts up and down to one another, or to center them in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>This Love is ſown in their nature; there is no attaining it, but where this nature is ſown. Man may reaſon himſelf into love of God (a kind of love,) and it is natural to him ſo to do, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thus love him; he hath not the root of this love in him, he hath not the nature whence it flows.</p>
            <p>O how excellent is this Love! O how ſtrong is this Love! Caſt this child into what ſtate you will, you cannot turn the heart of God one hairs bredth from him. Let God appear in what poſture he will, act how he will towards this Child, it cannot think hardly of him. The ſtreams of this Love run (though ſometimes inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly) forward and backward from each towards each in the midſt of all the varieties, changes, and ſtrange unlovely diſguiſes that both are clothed with. And O what torment is it to have this Love chained up! How doth it conſume and burn up the poor ſpirit within, when it cannot find its God to go forth upon, for it cannot move towards any thing elſe!</p>
            <p>It were a very pretty thing to obſerve the workings of this Love on both hands between God and them, in the ſeveral diſpenſations he carrieth them through. <hi>How gentle</hi> it maketh them both, <hi>how kind</hi> to one another! They can withhold nothing from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, They dare truſt one another with all they have. The child dares put himſelf into the hands of the Father, it is the pleaſure of the child to be ſubject to the will of the Father: The Father dareth truſt his whole Eſtate, his Name (then which nothing is dearer to him) every thing, in the hands of the child. <hi>How patient</hi> towards one another! God will bear any thing from them, they will bear any thing from God. How naturally do they interpret every thing well concerning one another, notwithſtanding all the contradictions and contrary apparitions of ſenſe! Surely, ſays God, <hi>they are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that will not lye,</hi> I will truſt them with Salvation: Surely, ſay they, <hi>God will not fail me, nor forſake me,</hi> I will follow him into the jaws of death and deſtruction. And if things appear never ſo contrary to what is expected or hoped, though it be quite ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in miſery, (contrary to all Promiſes and Aſſurances, as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but apprehend,) yet it will not beleeve what it feels, becauſe of the ſtrength of its Love: And though with its mouth it cannot
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:165768:13"/>
but at ſometimes complain, becauſe of the bitterneſs of its anguiſh; yet in heart it cannot think amiſs: Nay thoſe very complaints, be they never ſo bitter againſt God, yet they flow from Love, and he who had but a skilful eye to read them, might read Love in them. God never deals ſo ſharply with his People, but ſtill 'tis from Love and in Love, and they never ſpeak ſo hardly againſt God, but 'tis from Love and in Love too. Love is at bottom, and 'tis Love moves, 'tis Love complains; Love thus vents it ſelf, to eaſe it ſelf, that it might ſtrengthen it ſelf at the root.</p>
            <p>There is a two-fold Love between God and his People: <hi>A Love of Good-will,</hi> and <hi>a Love of Righteouſneſs and Iuſtice.</hi> They love one another from their nature, from that natural tye that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; and they love one another according to that worth and excellency they ſee in one another. A ſhadow of this we ſee in man: We love our kindred from and according to the bond of nature, and alſo from and according to that worth that appears in them.</p>
            <p>The former of theſe remains conſtant, is ſtill the ſame in both; The latter varies, according to the various appearances of worth and lovelineſs in each.</p>
            <p>It was the latter of theſe from which we fell. We fell from the Love of God according to our excellency, when we loſt our excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency: God could not then love us as excellent, when we were no longer excellent. And this Chriſt reſtoreth us unto in reſtoring us to our former beauty and excellency.</p>
            <p>So in this Love we vary towards God too. Though we always love him with the love of good-will, yet his Excellency is ſo hid from us that we cannot always love it, becauſe it is often (and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be) otherwiſe repreſented to us in this frail ſtate. His Ways, his Diſpenſations, his various Appearances are not throughly ſeen into by us, and ſo we cannot throughly love them, or him in them: but this Chriſt will alſo reſtore us to in opening that love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in them all, which is yet hid from us. And when this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly done, our hearts will perfectly flow forth in all manner of love one towards another; when we are made in every reſpect what God loves and eſteems, and when God is made to appear what he is, even every way pure, excellent and lovely in all his Ways and Motions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:165768:13"/>This Love both in God and in his (for it is one and the ſame) hath theſe ſix Properties in it. 1. It is <hi>Spiritual.</hi> 2. <hi>Pure.</hi> 3. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal.</hi> 4. <hi>Gradual.</hi> 5. <hi>Disperſive.</hi> 6. <hi>Conquering</hi> or Subduing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is Spiritual,</hi> of a divine Nature, of the Nature of God: Not of an earthly nature, not of the nature of any thing here below, but of an heavenly Nature, of the Nature of God. No man, no creature can thus love, but God alone: it dwells in him, it goes along with him; where he ſows his own Life, there he ſows this Love, and it is no where elſe to be found.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is Pure,</hi> it is not mixed, it will not mix with any thing: it will not go forth for any by ends, but from it ſelf, of its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it is <hi>of pure good-will, of exact Righteouſneſs.</hi> Where there is the nature it ſeeks, where there is the worth it ſeeks, it will, it cannot but love it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> it goes forth towards all things. God loveth himſelf, his Son, his Creatures, his Enemies; Heaven and Hell, Light and Darkneſs, Saints and Devils, Holineſs and Sin: It is a comprehenſive Love, takes in all things into its boſom. <hi>God is Love:</hi> as every thing hath its place in God, ſo every thing hath its proper place in his Love. God hath preſcribed us nothing but what is in himſelf, and he calls for it from us, becauſe he would have us like himſelf: He bids us <hi>love our enemies,</hi> becauſe he himſelf doth ſo; he hath no enemy but what he loves. O how vaſt are his Motions! He can hate with a perfect hatred, and yet love with a more perfect Love. And he, in whom this Love is grown up in ſtrength and power, finds it alſo ſpreading in him in this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality: There is nothing he can ſo hate, but he alſo loveth it; He knoweth Hell, Devil, Sin ſo well, that he can tell both how and wherein to hate and love them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It is Gradual:</hi> God loveth not all things alike, but every thing in its order, place and ſtation. He loveth himſelf firſt and chiefly, he loveth his Son as himſelf, he loveth his Creatures accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ſeveral ranks, Hell, Devil and Sin, in theirs; and that both with the love of good-will and of Righteouſneſs; all which are lovely in their ſeveral reſpects, though ſome of them are very unlovely both in themſelves and in their motions, yet all of them are very lovely in their ſubſerviency; and none of them can be ſpared.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:165768:14"/>
Yea the very nature of the very worſt of them (which is the worſt thing in them, far worſe then any of their motions and actions) hath its proper luſtre and lovelineſs to that eye which throughly diſcerneth it: The lovelineſs of darkneſs lieth in its black dark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in its contrariety to and oppoſition againſt light; and he who made it ſo, ſaw it lovely, and cannot but love it in its being ſo; and he, who is taken up into him, cannot but ſee its lovelineſs alſo, and love it with him.</p>
            <p>Yet there is an order and degree, as in things themſelves, ſo in Love's going forth towards them.</p>
            <p>A Maſter of a family loveth his whole family, every thing in it; his wife, his children, his ſervants, his vaſſals, his horſes, his oxen, his ſheep, his aſſes, his whole houſhold ſtuff, all his furniture, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of jewels, veſſels of gold, ſilver, wood, ſtone, braſs, tin, &amp;c. yet not all alike: Theſe have not all the ſame nearneſs to him, (though they have all ſome relation, and may challenge ſome love and reſpect:) Theſe are not all of the ſame nature, have not all the ſame make, are not all for the ſame uſe; They are not of the ſame worth in themſelves, they yeeld not the ſame delight unto him; but there is a vaſt difference in them, and cannot but be likewiſe in his love towards them.</p>
            <p>An excellent Work-man may like all his peeces of work, becauſe ſeveral veins of his skill appear in them all, yet ſtill with a difference. He hath his rude inferior draughts of things, which he careth not much for, which any almoſt may beg from him: but he hath ſome peeces he ſetteth ſo high a price upon, that he will by no means be drawn to part with them.</p>
            <p>God is <hi>THE GREAT OPERATOR,</hi> he has <hi>THE SKILL, (He is wonderful in Counſel, excellent in working:)</hi> but yet he works variouſly. He hath his ſlight peeces, as he reckoneth this Creation, which he made but for a Say, and regards not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of it, but maketh havock of it, and ſuffereth havock to be made of it continually. Such are all his outward Works, in his outward People, by his outward viſible Covenant: He never ſet much by the one, he never did any great thing by the other; he brought it forth to ſhew its weakneſs, its inſufficiency for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about of what he meant to do: And the love he beareth to it is for its weakneſs, for its fitneſs to ſet off the ſtrength of his other
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:165768:14"/>
Covenant when it ſhould be brought forth. But God hath his peeces of Skill, he hath his accurate peeces of Work which he hath brought forth all his Wiſdom in, wherein there are <hi>the very depths of God</hi> running in their ſeveral ſecret lines; theſe he is very dainty of. He loveth every thing; but yet wiſely, in its order and place, according to its nature, end and uſe. His Love is not ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed love, as muſt go forth with its whole ſtrength, or not at all; but he hath Wiſdom and Judgment to guide it by, to let it out as may yeeld him moſt pleaſure, and may moſt commend and ſet it off in its going forth; which conſiſts in the perfect variety of objects, and in the perfect variety of acts and ways of motion. The ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and enjoying of the whole ſtrength of his heart would not be ſo choyce, rare and excellent, if it were over-common. But when none hath it but <hi>his Spouſe, his Children, his Jewels,</hi> it will appear what it is to be his Spouſe, to be his Child, to be his Jewel. And when he hath none elſe to love, enjoy and delight in, as them; his delight in them will be more precious and pleaſing to himſelf. God will have, can have but one Spouſe; and his Spouſe will not, cannot endure the leaſt jot of his husbandly affection to run aſide from her, no more then he can ſuffer the leaſt Spouſe-like affection of hers to run aſide from him. They ſhall each love every thing elſe, but nothing ſo as they love one another.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>It is Disperſive:</hi> This Love ſows and ſcatters it ſelf every where. There is not any thing any where, but God is there; it is in God, and God is in it. God hath excluded himſelf from many things, yea from moſt things in ſome conſiderations, but yet he is ſtill there in other conſiderations; and where he is, his Love is: And how remote ſoever things appear at preſent from him, yet he will have a time to diſcover himſelf, and conſequently his Love, in them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>It is Conquering,</hi> it is Subduing, it ſubjects all things to it ſelf. <hi>Love is ſtronger then death:</hi> The Love that is in every thing will one day, when it diſcovers its ſtrength, conquer the Death that is in every thing: (and the Conqueſt muſt be where the Combate is, even in the heart of every thing.) <hi>Nothing is able to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Love: If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirſt, give him drink; hereby thou ſhalt heap coals of fire upon his head,</hi> and he ſhall not be able to hold out againſt the engines and art of Love.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:165768:15"/>
If we had but Love enough, we might conquer our greateſt enemies; God hath Love enough, and therefore can conquer his greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: He can chain them up by Power, but that is nothing ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Conqueſt as to change them by Love. The letting looſe of pure and perfect Love will charm all the enmity and oppoſition in the bittereſt and fierceſt adverſary.</p>
            <p>Now do not ſay, O Man, theſe things cannot be. There is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuch a Love in God, who cannot but delight to give it full vent; And when Wrath hath had its full ſcope, why ſhould not Love (which cannot be always bound) have its turn? Wrath comes from Love, and in its greateſt heat is ſubject unto Love, and why ſhould it not at length be ſwallowed up in Love? Love cannot be perfect in its work, while it ſuffers an enemy to remain: and its Conqueſt being ſo ſweet, excellent and univerſally good, how can it but deſire and delight to conquer? If Love be the beſt thing, the moſt univerſally pleaſing and profitable, why ſhould it not delight to diffuſe it ſelf? how can it reſt until it hath diffuſed it ſelf? Was there any thing but Love, before things were brought forth in ſuch a way, as they might be expoſed to hatred? When there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God, was there any hatred in him? Doth any man hate his own fleſh, himſelf? And how can Love be quiet, until it hath reduced all into Love and lovelineſs again? Surely, ſaith my Soul, Love muſt want ſtrength, or it cannot ſuffer miſery always to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. If I had power in me anſwerable to the love I find ſown and ſpringing up in me, I could not endure the miſery of any thing. Whence cometh this? what is this, being interpreted? Is not this from, and a ſhadow of that Love, which wants not this power, nor this good-will, nor skill to do it in a way of Righteouſneſs? (Is it not juſt for Love to recover all it once had and poſſeſſed, if it can?) And this may God do, to my underſtanding, (which ſince he hath broken it, gives him his ſcope in doing what he pleaſes, in ſpeaking what he pleaſes, in interpreting his own words as he pleaſes,) and not contradict any thing he hath ſaid, but only our weak creaturely apprehenſion of things, who have meaſured his declaration of his Intentions, not in his light, but in our own.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>SElf-denyal</hi> is the firſt ſtep in Chriſtianity, that which Chriſt firſt teaches and requires to have learnt of any, before he will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of them into his School, before he will undertake to train them up as his Diſciples. It is that which makes way for all the Leſſons which he teacheth afterwards, without which none of them can be learnt, and by which they are all made eaſie: He who hath learn'd to deny himſelf, will quickly learn to bear his Croſs, to dye with Chriſt dayly, yea to live and move towards God in and through Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Self</hi> is <hi>the natural man, the earthly principle, (Adam</hi> in his own nature,) which is of the earth, and tends to the earth, which is ever ſinking into that corruption which makes way for death. This <hi>Self,</hi> where ever it is, where ever it hath a Being, it cannot but ſeek to preſerve and make uſe of its Being in motion and activity, which as it comes from it ſelf, ſo it centers in it ſelf: it may move towards God, towards any ſpiritual thing, yet it is from Self, and for Self that it ſo moves.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Self,</hi> being corrupted, hath moſt of its principles, motions and ends in and from corruption; yet it will not reſt there, but wanders up and down every where for ſecurity; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within its reach but it will lay hold on, if it may hope for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from it or through it: There is nothing can be propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it to beleeve, but it will beleeve; nothing can be propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it to practiſe, but it will practiſe; yea it will not fall ſhort in the very accurateneſs of Self-denyal it ſelf.</p>
            <p>There was never yet any Fabrick that God reared for himſelf, for his own Spirit to make uſe of, or to dwell in; but our ſpirits, our <hi>Self</hi> hath entered in after him, hoping to live there with him, and to be ſafe there through him, through his preſence and help. When the Lord built a material <hi>Temple</hi> which he appeared in, how did the ſpirits of <hi>fleſhly Iſrael</hi> cling unto it, how did <hi>Fleſh, Self,</hi> corrupt

all thoſe Ordinances and wayes of Worſhip which were once plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but by it made abhominable in the eyes of God.</p>
            <p>There is no Form (take the expreſſion as largely as ye can) either of outward or inward worſhip, but <hi>fleſh, ſelf,</hi> will intrude thither, will be making uſe of it, will be corrupt there and corrupting it. It will enter into all <hi>Duties, Ordinances,</hi> into <hi>all Spirituall Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of every kind, into <hi>Faith,</hi> into <hi>Love,</hi> into <hi>Humility, Patience, Meekneſs, heavenly mindedneſs,</hi> there <hi>Self</hi> will be, in theſe poſtures will <hi>Self</hi> act and move. There is not any ſtrain of Religion ſo pure, not a notion or apprehenſion ſo ſpiritual, not a viſion or revelation ſo ſublime, and ſeemingly remote from Self, but Self will be climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and getting into it, putrifying and preparing it for Eternal fire, which will not be quenched (when once it is kindled) until it hath burnt up fleſh, burnt up Self where ever it finds it. And though theſe now ſeem very glorious, ſmell very ſweet, (O how Fleſh is pleaſed and raviſhed here!) yet when the Eternal fire is let looſe upon them they will ſtink extreamly (nothing ſcents worſe then burnt fleſh) and then <hi>in ſtead of a ſweet ſavor there will be a ſtink.</hi> Ye begin to ſmell the fleſh in your Ordinances, in your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ye ſhall ſmell it in your Graces too, yea in the pureſt intireſt motions that ever your ſpirits went out in.</p>
            <p>This ſickneſs is ſo deep, this leproſie ſo ſpread, that it will be very coſtly to have it purged out, and the perſon cured. The whole houſe muſt be pulled down, the whole building, the ſpiritual Temple as well as the material, and every ſtone burnt in the fire. Every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, all ſpiritual Knowledg, every ſpiritual Motion muſt be rent, confounded, torn in peeces, ſo that there will be no ſight or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of them left. We ſhall be perfectly loſt in the life of our ſpirits, before the life of the fleſh come to be loſt in us. And the corruption of the fleſh will ſo ſtink, in every thing that is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, when it comes to be burnt, that we ſhall think there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, nothing but corruption in them; becauſe at preſent (in the time of its burning) we can ſee nothing elſe, and ſee and ſmell that ſo ſtrong.</p>

Nay <hi>Fleſh, Self,</hi> that is got into theſe motions, will ſmell more abominably (when it is caſt into the fire) then that which concents it ſelf to dwell and act in the groſſeſt: And the day may come that thou mayſt prefer the ſwaring, drinking, curſing, blaſpheming, uncleanneſs of thoſe that are now loathſom unto thee in this reſpect, before thine own praying, beleeving, loving of God, &amp;c. The inward intenſe, ſpiritual wickedneſs that lies hid in theſe, is of a thouſand-fold deeper nature then that groſſneſs which appears in the other. As <hi>the Spirit of Life</hi> is moſt excellent in theſe, beyond what he is in outward appearances, (The Spirit of Life triumphs in the new Creature, in the new Creation, in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Life:) So <hi>the ſpirit of man, Self, Fleſh</hi> is moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable here, far ſurpaſſing the common curruption of mankind, both in the nature and degree of wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>Man can never learn to deny himſelf. He can indeed both learn and practiſe this Leſſon after his manner, as he doth other Leſſons of the ſame nature, <hi>viz.</hi> truly and ſubſtantially to his own judgment, but not to Gods. As he can beleeve, and that upon Scripture-Grounds, love God upon ſpiritual Conſiderations: So he can deny himſelf, he can move not for his own ends, but from the Excellency in God and ſpiritual things. Man can make every action and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his weighty in his own ballance, but for all that they are light in Gods: Thy Faith is not Faith (though bottomed on Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Grounds and Promiſes) thy Love is not Love, thy Self-denyal is not Self-denyal, thou doſt not throw down, but ſet up thy ſelf in thy pureſt motions, ends, deſires. To avoyd miſery (eternal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery) to obtain glory (an eternal weight of glory) what would not poor Self do! How hard will it run the race for this prize, and ſtrip it ſelf as naked of Self, as may be, that it may ſo run as to obtain! and yet it is not ſtript, it doth not run, it cannot obtain. Ah poor man, what will become of thee! Of what nature, thinkeſt thou, are all thy ſigns, and all thy Evidences, by which thou weigheſt things concerning thy ſelf <hi>in the ballance of the Sanctuary,</hi> as thou ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineſt; but in truth doſt but turn them up and down in the ſcale

of thine own uncertain reaſon and underſtanding, which by a falſe finger thou ſtill makeſt ſpeak well for thy ſelf!

            <p>But there is New-Man, who cannot but learn to deny himſelf, for it is written in his nature, ſo that it is as hard for him to ſeek himſelf, as it is for the other to deny himſelf.

               <hi>Was the Word.</hi> A word with us, is that which we ſpeak: a Word with God, is that which he ſpeaks, who has the compleat
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:165768:17"/>
Subſtance in himſelf of every thing which is (but weakly) ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in us. God ſpeaks often, hath many words, and yet but one: His ſeveral Words expreſs parts (as I may ſay) parcels of him; his one Word this one Word expreſſeth him all, expreſſeth him wholly, expreſſeth him fully. This is <hi>the Original Word</hi> whereof all other Words are but Copies: This is <hi>the perfect Word,</hi> wherein God ſpake out himſelf perfectly; wherein he ſpake the whole God-head as fully as it could be ſpoken, in whom he brought forth his own inviſibility into view, <hi>he is the expreſs Image of the inviſible God,</hi> his likeneſs is juſt as may be, his own Word that came out of his own Mouth from his very Heart, and hath all his Heart engraven upon it, ſo that he who can read this Word, may read the whole Godhead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the beginning was the Word.</hi> When other things did but begin to be, then the Word was: He had his full, his perfect Being before any thing elſe: <hi>He was before all things, and by him do all things ſubſiſt.</hi> The Word was not only when other things were, but before other things were. He was <hi>in the beginning,</hi> nay indeed he was the Beginning: <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the firſt and the last.</hi> He was the firſt that came from God, and the laſt that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns into God. He was that Point in the Circle out of which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing was let, and into which every thing runs back, and returns with him into the Circle again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Word was with God.</hi> Would you know where the Word was in the beginning? <hi>it was with God.</hi> This was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Word: This Word did not ſo go forth from God, but that it ſtill remained in and with God. This Word God brought forth both within himſelf, to live and remain in him, and without himſelf, for him to live and dwell in: And whoever are made one with this Word, muſt become the ſame; They muſt be Gods Houſe. Gods Temple, and God muſt be their Houſe, their Temple; they muſt dwell in God, and God in them. The Creature, the Creation, when it was brought forth, it was to be removed at a diſtance from God: God would have communion with the Creature but when and as he pleaſed, after what manner, and by what rule he pleaſed. He would not dwell in the ſame houſe with him, he would not keep continual company with him, but he would come, and walk, and converſe with him at what ſeaſons he ſaw good: He puts
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:165768:18"/>
               <hi>Adam</hi> into the Garden, but there he leaves him, and what befell him, while he left him, we all too well know. But <hi>the Son abideth in the houſe for ever;</hi> the Father ever abideth with the Son; the Blood, the Life, the Spirit of the Father continually runneth in the veins of the Son. The Word was ever with God, and God was ever with the Word; the Son lay ever in his boſom, and he lay ever in his Sons boſom. The Word was made (for he was <hi>the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Creation of God</hi>) for his own immediate and everlaſting Poſſeſſion. When he keeps him within himſelf, he poſſeſſes him there; when he ſends him forth, he goes forth with him, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes him there alſo; <hi>I am not alone, but the Father is with me:</hi> They never are alone, they never act alone; but where the Father is, the Son is; and where the Son is, the Father is; what the Father does, the Son does; and what the Son does, the Father does in him: He is not, he acts not, he ſpeaks not, but the Father in him; the Father is not, acts not, ſpeaks not, but in him. Here him expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this himſelf, how he was with God in the beginning.</p>

I was not the firſt in this Creation, but <hi>from the beginning,</hi> before

               <hi>ever the Earth was.</hi> Not from the beginning of this Creation, that is but a ſhadow of the beginning, as well as all the things creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are but ſhadows of ſomewhat elſe, but from <hi>the beginning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> from that beginning which was a beginning from everlaſting, where all things do begin and end in another-gheſs manner then can be ſhadowed out by draughts of Creation to a created eye: and from then <hi>was I ſet up.</hi>

The firſt thing we read of was <hi>the great deep,</hi> and the deeps they are the wonders of God, and where he does wonders, <hi>Theſe ſee the Works of the Lord, and his Wonders in the deep.</hi> And <hi>the Fountains of Waters</hi> are one of his Maſter-peeces in this Creation, <hi>Worſhip him who made the Heaven, the Earth, the Seas, and the Fountains of Waters.</hi> Yea but there was a more wonderful thing brought forth then theſe, before any of theſe; <hi>When there were no dephs, I was brought forth: when no Fountains abounding with water.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 25. <hi>Before the Mountains were ſetled, before the Hills was I brought forth.</hi> The <hi>depths and fountains,</hi> they are the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent things in the Waters: The <hi>mountains and hills,</hi> they are as eminent in the Land, or dry part of the Creation. What mighty mountains are there up and down throughout the whole Earth? and what a peece of work was it, think you, to ſettle and fix theſe in their places; or to bring forth all the hills throughout the whole world? and yet I was before them, I was brought forth before them. <hi>Before the mountains were ſetled, before the hills was I brought forth.</hi>

               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 26. <hi>While as yet he had not made the Earth, nor the open places, nor the chief part of the duſt of the World.</hi> He ſpeaks very accurately, as one who was very well acquainted with the work of Creation. He divides the Earth into three parts, or repreſents it under three Conſiderations. There is the bulk of it, which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hid; Then there is the ſurface or open part of it, which lieth open to the eye of the creature for it to view and behold; and then there is the ſpirituous part of it, wherein is as it were the life and excellency of the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nor the chief part of the dust of the World.</hi> There is a choyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:165768:19"/>
in Earth as well as in other things, and God hath a ſpecial eye to the chief part. The duſt is the lighteſt part, the moſt minute and ſpirituous, the fitteſt to be formed into any thing, <hi>(God formed man of the dust of the Earth:)</hi> and he hath a choyceneſs in duſt too. But before he made either the bulk of the Earth, or the open part of it, or the chief part of the duſt of the World, I was brought forth, and ſtood by him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>When he prepared the Heavens, I was there: when he ſet a Compaſs (or Circle) upon the face of the depth.</hi> Here are two wonderful things more: his preparing Heaven and Earth. He had Works to form and faſhion above, as well as beneath; he had Heavens to make, as well as Earth. He takes the matter he would make the Heavens of, the Sun, Moon, Stars, and all that Hoſt, the ſeveral Regions and Orbs there, and prepares it for it, makes it ready for himſelf to work upon, to caſt into what form he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And he takes the depth out of which, and within which he would make the dry Land and the Sea (which were jumbled together in one Maſs) and draws a line about it, within this Compaſs, ſaith he, will I do it. When he did this, ſays <hi>Wiſdom (Wiſdom brought forth,</hi> which was <hi>the Word</hi>) I was there, I ſaw him do it, I knew his meaning in it, I perceived the very skill whereby he wrought it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>When he eſtabliſhed the Clouds above: when he ſtrengthened the Fountains of the deep:</hi> The Clouds had need be well faſtened, or they would ſoon drop down. They are ſuch great Curtains, they had not need only be faſtened at the ends, but up and down every where: God perceived this well enough in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and ſtretching them out, and therefore when he had made them, and ſet them in their places, he <hi>establiſhed</hi> them. And the Fountains, that continually yeeld ſo much water, <hi>the Fountains of the deep</hi> (that muſt yeeld waters to maintain all Seas and Rivers, and ſupply the continual expence of waters from each, whereof the Earth ſucks in much, and from whence the multitude of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both on the Earth and in the Ayr, draw much) had need of good ſtore, it requites a great ſtock to nouriſh theſe: therefore the Lord, when he had made them, he <hi>ſtrengthened</hi> them, that they might have fulneſs in themſelves, and be able to fill all their veſſels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:165768:19"/>Verſ. 29. <hi>When he gave to the Sea his Decree, that the Waters ſhould not paſs his Commandment: when he appointed the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth.</hi> The Sea is very violent and unruly, not to be <hi>tamed by mankinde</hi> as other creatures are. The Foundations of the Earth are very vaſt things, as hard to be maſtered as tha Sea. But God who made both knows how to rule both; and when he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided them he gave each their bounds. He gave the Sea <hi>his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree;</hi> hither may it go, but here muſt it ſtop, <hi>the pride of its waves</hi> muſt not ſwell further: Neither may the Foundations of the Earth thruſt the Sea out of its place, but keep their own ſtation and limits, which he likewiſe appointed them.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was dayly his delight, rejoycing always before him.</hi> I then ſtood by him and ſaw him do all theſe things, and underſtood his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and intent, comprehending him fully in every one of them: I was then as one that ſtood by him, having the view and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of his whole operation in this Fabrick from firſt to laſt. Nor was I by him as one then newly brought forth, as the firſt peece of the Creation; but <hi>as one brought up with him,</hi> as one who had always been with him; as one in whom he always delighted, whom he could never tell how to paſs a day pleaſantly without, <hi>I was dayly his delight.</hi> Chriſt is <hi>the delight of God,</hi> he whom God evermore delighted in, he who was ſtill ſo like himſelf, ſo perfect and unchangeable in the Image of himſelf, that God could not but take continual pleaſure in beholding himſelf in this glaſs: yea he was ſo taken with this repreſentation of himſelf that he could never leave off looking on it. He could never forbear looking on him, and every look was pleaſant to him, (it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for God to be cloyed with Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <hi>I was dayly his delight.</hi> Man is not ſo pleaſed to behold himſelf, as to behold his Image in his Son, that is his pleaſure, his content, the delight of his heart: And 'tis the delight and pleaſure of God, not ſimply to ſee himſelf in himſelf, but to ſee himſelf brought forth in Chriſt, to behold this Image, this draught of himſelf perfectly brought forth, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally durable; to behold every thing of himſelf brought forth in him, living in him acting in him; This is his delight, the very joy of his heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rejoycing always before him.</hi> Chriſt is not onely delightful to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:165768:20"/>
God, but delightful in himſelf before God, <hi>rejoycing before him.</hi> Gods heart is full of joy and delight in Chriſt and becauſe of Chriſt, and Chriſts heart is full of joy before God, he is ever rejoycing. Where God and Chriſt are together there is nothing but delight and joy, delight in God, joy in Chriſt; God delighting in Chriſt, and Chriſt rejoycing before God. <hi>Rejoycing always before him.</hi> The mirth and rejoycing of the Childe is exceedingly pleaſing to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſpecially when it is in his preſence, and when it flows from the delight and pleaſure he hath in the Father. The Father is pleaſed with all his excellencies and perfections as they are brought forth in Chriſt: Chriſt he is pleaſed with them as they dwell originally in the Father. The Father pours out <hi>his own Spirit of Joy</hi> into the Son, anointing him abundantly <hi>with the oyl of gladneſs;</hi> and the Son pours forth that joy abundantly and continually in the preſence of the Father, he is ever rejoycing before him, rejoycing in the Perſon of the Father, delighting in the Works of the Father, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee how every thing comes from him, how every thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to him, how every thing makes for him, how every thing is full of him, how every thing is fully in him. Oh how raviſhing would it be to any eye, to any heart, to behold things in Chriſt as God beholds them there, or to behold things in God as Chriſt beholds them there! He who once is led to this, will meet with true joy with Chriſt, with true delight with God; he cannot forbear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting himſelf in Chriſt with God, nor from rejoycing continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with Chriſt before God.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>Rejoycing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights were with the ſons of men.</hi> Chriſt doth onely rejoyce in God; but in every thing that comes from God; as God doth not onely rejoyce in Chriſt, but in every thing that he brings forth through Chriſt. There is nothing diſpleaſeth Chriſt in any thing but its diſtance from God; There is nothing diſpleaſeth God in any thing, but its diſtance from Chriſt: They ſo entirely love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they care not for beholding any thing, deſire not to enjoy any thing, but in one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rejoycing in the habitable part of his earth.</hi> Heaven and Earth and all things in both had a Being in God, a more compleat ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Being then this ſhadowy Being wherein they are brought forth and outwardly appear: There Chriſt knew them, there Chriſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:165768:20"/>
rejoyced in them, from thence Chriſt brought them forth into this ſtate and kinde of being wherein they are; thither will Chriſt bring them back again, and rejoyce in them again; alaſs, this preſent ſtate is not a ſtate to be rejoyced in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Earth. The Earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof;</hi> It is his own, it came from him, it was framed by him, he made the matter of it, he formed and ſhaped it, it was what it was by him, it is what it is according to his pleaſure and for him, it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to weakneſs and vanity for his ſake, and he knows and owns it, in a way unknown to it, in the midſt of all its weakneſs and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Man, if he be a little exalted, doth preſently deſpiſe that which appears weak and beneath him: but God, who is <hi>mighty in ſtrength and wiſdom, despiſeth not: Job</hi> 36.5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The habitable part of his Earth.</hi> In the Earth, <hi>in his Earth</hi> there are habitable and inhabitable parts (this outward Fabrick is a true draught of the inward, though a dark and defaced one;) He changeth it as he pleaſeth, maketh it habitable or inhabitable as he pleaſeth: but his work lyeth moſt ſtill at preſent in the habitable part; there he is moſt active, his glory is moſt ſown there, and moſt ſeen from thence, there Chriſt is at work with him, and rejoycing in his work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And my delights were with the ſons of men.</hi> The ſons of men are the chief part in Gods Earth, even in the habitable part of it, according as they were brought forth the chief part of this ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy Earth, they have the ſpecial ſtamp and Image of God upon them, the excellency and quinteſſence of the whole Creation is contracted into them, the life and glory of God is ſown in them, this the ſoyl for it to ſpring up in, grow in, diſcover it ſelf in, this is <hi>his Tabernacle,</hi> this is <hi>his holy Land, &amp;c.</hi> and accordingly Chriſts delights were chiefly here, <hi>and my delights were with the ſons of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lo this is <hi>the Word,</hi> thus he <hi>was with God,</hi> and this was his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Word was God.</hi> He was with God, and he was God. He was not with God as a ſtranger, as a meer beholder of him and his works, as one at a great diſtance from him, but as one with him. As God brought him forth out of himſelf, ſo he brought him forth as himſelf, he brought forth himſelf in him; he brought forth his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:165768:21"/>
own life, his own Wiſdom, his own Power, his own Eternity, his own Immortality, which remains the ſame now as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; it was God before, and it is God ſtill, it was God in it ſelf, and it is God in him. Chriſt is but God breathed out, and God is but Chriſt drawn in. He is <hi>the Image of the inviſible God,</hi> yet not a bare Image, but a living Image, an Image wherein the whole por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture and lineaments, yea the very life and ſubſtance of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is engraven. Where ever God forms Chriſt he forms himſelf, for he is but himſelf a little diverſified, and that with the leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction that may be; it is himſelf in the firſt ſtep of deſcent, it is himſelf in his firſt and moſt immediate going forth, it is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and moſt perfect forming of God (it is a Scripture-phraſe, <hi>before me was no God formed.</hi>) God is formed in the Creature, but it is very difficult to read him there, the likeneſs is ſo ſmall, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeneſs ſo great: but it is eaſie to read him in Chriſt. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds Chriſt, cannot but behold God; He that underſtands and knows Chriſt, cannot but know God: for there is nothing but God in him. He is the true draught of the Godhead, he in whom God came forth, in whom God is, in whom God dwells, who hath filled every part of him with himſelf, who ſhineth through him, and cannot but be ſeen where he is ſeen. Chriſt is every thing that God is, is every where where God is, does every thing that God does, <hi>All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made:</hi> All things are ordered and governed by him, <hi>he upholdeth all things by the Word of his Power: Hebr.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Word was God.</hi> Not his fleſh, that is but his garment, it is no part of him no more then our clothes are of us, onely indeed in this reſpect it is ſomewhat neerer, becauſe he took it up as an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting garment. Our fleſh is no part of us, no part of the new-man, no part of Chriſt in us, it is but our garment; and his fleſh is but his garment, which he took up not for any need he had of it, or from any love to it, but becauſe he would be like us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he found it ſomewhat advantagious to him to expreſs his love to us, to perform ſome offices of love for us in; <hi>becauſe the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were partakers of fleſh and blood, he himſelf alſo took part of the ſame: Hebr.</hi> 2. <hi>The Word was made fleſh;</hi> He was made or became, he put himſelf into that appearance, he partook
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:165768:21"/>
of it with his Brethren, but it was no part of him, nor had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to him, otherwiſe then as it was aſſumed by him. It is an imaginary deſcription which many give of Chriſt, that he is God in fleſh, God in weakneſs: No, he is God in ſtrength, God in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; <hi>The Wiſdom of God, the Power of God, the Arm of the Lord</hi> wherein all his ſtrength lies; the skill of God whereby he does every thing (by him he made the Worlds;) the ſtorehouſe, the treaſury wherein the whole fulneſs of the Godhead is locked up and dwells in its own perfection. It is true <hi>he was made fleſh,</hi> he entred into a ſtate of weakneſs, but what was he who became fleſh, who entred into this ſtate of weakneſs? It was <hi>the Word,</hi> and <hi>that Word was God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Man, Behold <hi>thy Saviour,</hi> know <hi>thy life;</hi> do not deſpiſe <hi>Eternity</hi> becauſe of its appearing in and acting through <hi>mortality.</hi> This is he who came to redeem thee, to be a propitiatory ſacrifice for thee, and a pattern to thee. Art thou able to meaſure God in any work of his through the Creature? Thou knoweſt thou art nor; why then doſt thou meaſure him ſo confidently in his greateſt work through his Chriſt, even the work of Redemption, and ſo apparantly contradict him in it? He lays the ſtreſs on <hi>that Death of his Son</hi> which he underwent, when he offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>in his Body on the Croſs through the Eternal Spirit:</hi> Thou ſlighteſt that, lookeſt upon it as nothing but a type, making the ſubſtance to be the death of Chriſt in thee. Indeed it is a type, and the death of Chriſt in thee is the ſubſtance of it, ſo far as it is a type of it: but is it no more then a type? Was there nothing done but onely a repreſentation of what was to be done in thee and in others? Search, read, ſee, conſider what is ſpoken concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that once dying of his, <hi>by that one offering hath he for ever perfected them that are ſanctified.</hi> Poor ſhallow Man cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend God or any thing of God, he can ſee but one peece but one ſide or any of his works at once, and in beholding and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that, he is ſtill ready to contradict the other which at that time he ſeeth not. He who looks on Chriſt without, and is taken up with beholding that death, little thinks he that he muſt feel the ſame within, <hi>that he muſt be baptiz d with the ſame Baptiſm, that he muſt drink of the ſame Cup.</hi> He who ſees and feels that death within, finding the power, efficacy and vertue of it there,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:165768:22"/>
preſently inclines to ſlight the other, to look upon it as a meer ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; yet not as comprehending it, not as truly and throughly knowing it, but as having loſt the ſight of it, by being taken up with the ſight and ſenſe of what is wrought within: and ſo he paſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous judgment, undervaluing that which is the foundation of this, and has the main influence into this, by vertue whereof this is wrought.</p>

               <hi>O vain Man, thou wouldſt fain be wiſe, though thou beeft born a wilde Aſſes Colt!</hi> Thou art ſtill ſearching after knowledg, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting a fabrick of wiſdom, though thou haſt no capacity in thee of receiving or entertaining either.

            <head>Of the two Principles, Seeds or Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their different Natures, Motions, and Ends.</head>
            <p>THere are <hi>two Creations,</hi> made by one and the ſame workman, which have both of them their ſeveral diſtinct <hi>Natures, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Ends,</hi> according to their frame and conſtitution, and are both excellent in their <hi>kinde,</hi> and for that <hi>uſe</hi> to which they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>The one is weak, frail, periſhing, made and appointed as a foyl to ſet off the beauty, excellency and perfection of the other; (which if it were of the nature of the other, it could not do, and ſo ſhould loſe its own proper excellency, vertue and uſe: for the excellency of every thing lyeth in its own nature, and in its ſuitableneſs by its nature to its end and uſe. If ſin were not black in its nature, vile in every motion, did not tend both in its nature and motions to death and deſtruction, it were not excellent, it would be a dull tool without an edg, which is no way lovely or commendable.)</p>
            <p>The one hath all manner of excellency in it, but appears weak, poor, low: The other maketh a great ſhew of much worth, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, excellency, but is nothing but emptineſs and vanity at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. The one ſpreads little, but hath abundance of life and ſtrength at root: The other ſpreads abundantly, its branches, leaves, fruit are very fair and flouriſhing, but it is putrified at the root.</p>
            <p>Theſe two have their diſtinct Natures, and accordingly their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct motions and ends, which they ſtill retain in all the varieties and changes which they are made to undergo.</p>
            <p>Clothe the firſt Creation how you will, it is but ſtill Earth; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it whither you will, mount it up to Heaven, it remains Earth there; let in what glory can be let in upon it, it is ſtill but Earth. The other, the ſecond Creation, lay it as low as you will, bring it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:165768:23"/>
down into the Earth, clothe it with Earth, bury it in the very <hi>bowels of the Earth,</hi> it ſtill retains its own heavenly life and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>So for their <hi>Motions:</hi> They ſtill move according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Let Earth be tryed to the utmoſt, throughly frighted into Spirituality, driven to ſeek ſhelter in the life and power of God to preſerve it ſelf from periſhing, be put upon moving towards God, towards Heaven; or it ſees it is undone for ever; it cannot for all this move ſpiritually, but will be like it ſelf (though moving to the utmoſt, yet) earthly in all theſe motions. On the other hand, Let the ſpiritual Principle be thruſt out of Heaven into the Earth, be ſhut up from all ſpiritual life and motion there, have no happineſs, peace, reſt, content day nor night, but what it can ſuck in from and through the Earth: alaſs! for all this it cannot move earthlily, it cannot reſt or take in delight from the Earth; if it cannot finde its own life it will refuſe to live, it will chuſe death rather then the life of the Earth.</p>
            <p>And for their <hi>Ends,</hi> they are according to their Natures and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The one tends to Condemnation, to Death; the other to Juſtification, to Life. Involve Earth, as much as may be, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in Life; it will be ſinking into Death and Hell again: Binde Heaven, as much as may be, in the Grave, in Hell, its life will be breaking all bonds, and mounting upwards, when its ſtrength is grown it will not be held back, but will return into its own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Inheritance.</p>
            <p>Theſe two, they differ in their ſeed or root, in their bulk or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in their branches, leaves, fruit; in their ſubſtance, vertue, quality, from their very riſe unto their very end in every thing.</p>
            <p>The Scripture holds out this abundantly every where, teſtifying concerning two diſtinct trees, <hi>trees of righteouſneſs,</hi> trees of Gods planting, trees that grow in his Garden, in his Vineyard, and <hi>trees of wickedneſs,</hi> wilde Olives, wilde Vines, <hi>their Vine is the Vine of Sodom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Trees have diſtinct roots, of diſtinct natures, the one whereof is earthly, of this Creation, and ſo weak and corrupt; the other is heavenly, of the other Creation, of a nature more inward, ſtrong and pure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:165768:23"/>They have likewiſe diſtinct branches, leaves and fruit, which as each grow from their own root, ſo they have their diſtinct vertue, keeping that nature which they have from the root: The one is ſtill ſowing and bearing fruit to the fleſh, the other to the Spirit.</p>
            <p>They have alſo (both the tree, leaf and fruit) their diſtinct ſhape and Image; the one the Image of the earthly, the other the Image of the heavenly. There is the Image of God, of Chriſt every where throughout the New Creation, in every peece and parcel of it, in every motion of any part of it: <hi>The Faith, Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, Humility, Patience, Praying, Waiting, &amp;c.</hi> of the new man have the Image of the Father and of Chriſt in them, whereas the beſt of theſe in man and from man are but earthly.</p>
            <p>And they have their diſtinct ends. The one, with all that comes from them, with all that belongs to them, ſhal be caſt into and periſh in the fire, ſhall be like chaff before the wind, toſſed up and down by it, ſhall return from whence they came, ſhall receive their death where they had their life: The other ſhall only be purified in the fire from that which encumbereth it, and is death unto it, and its end ſhall be reſt and peace, Juſtification in it ſelf with all its ways and motions, and perfect union and communion with God, which the other ſhall never be admitted unto. <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked: for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap. For he that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption: but he that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They differ alſo in their circuit and courſe. The one begins in life, and ends in death, begins in ſtrength, and ends in weakneſs, begins in glory, and ends in ſhame, begins in order, but ends in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion: The other begins with death, weakneſs, ſhame, confuſion, but ends in perfect life, ſtrength, glory, and order. This Creation was brought forth in its perfection, it began gloriouſly, but it wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and dyes dayly; its life, its glory is like a wind that paſſeth away and comes to nothing, for it returneth not again: The other Creation is but as ſeed ſown in this Creation, which hardly appears to have any life or excellency in it, and its growth is very weak and gradual, but withall it doth ſpring up, and will grow, until it arrive at Life and Perfection.</p>
            <p>Theſe two <hi>Principles, Seeds, Creations,</hi> the fleſhly, the earthly,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:165768:24"/>
and the ſpiritual and heavenly, are together, live together, move together in the renewed man, and cannot perfectly be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either in themſelves or motions. The ſpiritual Principle goes up and down through the Earth with the earthly, extracting God out of every thing, and feeding upon God in every thing, turning every thing into heavenlineſs, into ſpirituality, into life, that it meets with. The earthly Principle goeth up and down alſo into Heaven, and among heavenly things, with the ſpiritual, with the heavenly, making them earthly to it ſelf, and feeding its earthlineſs with them, extracting Earth out of Heaven, blowing upon, and tainting every ſpiritual excellency that it hath to do with. And theſe can neither of them have eaſe, reſt or content, the one being ſtill diſturbed by the other: Neither of them can move freely, nor enjoy it ſelf fully, becauſe the other is ſtill ſtriving to move and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it ſelf (as its nature ſtill guides it) in that which is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. O how welcom will a ſeparation be to both! The one would leap into the fire to get rid of the other, nay either would chuſe to live rather in the fire then with the other.</p>
            <p>The condemnation, which is to iſſue out upon the firſt Creation, is double, (which may eaſily be diſcerned every where, in every thing, by him that can read, it is ſo plainly written upon every thing.) One is, becauſe of their deviating from their ſtate and kind, for falling ſhort of that excellency which is proper to them, and which they might attain in a far greater degree then they do, for not being what they ſhould and might be: Every ſeed hath dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from its kind, <hi>all fleſh hath corrupted its way before the Lord,</hi> and ſo lieth open to condemnation for its degeneration, for its corruption. The other is in reſpect of their kind, which ſhall be made appear to be weak, ſhallow, imperfect, and ſo not fit to be ſuffered to remain, but fit only to make fuel for the fire againſt that great time of burning which is deſigned concerning <hi>the Earth, and all the works therein,</hi> which muſt then be <hi>burnt up.</hi> Such is all the righteouſneſs and excellency of the Creature, and therefore though it were as compleat in any as it was in <hi>Adam,</hi> yet it muſt come under condemnation: And though it ſhould be juſtified in and according to its nature, for being what, and acting according to what it was made; yet it ſhould be condemned for the weakneſs of its nature, as being but a ſhadow and Image ſuited only to repreſent
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:165768:24"/>
ſomewhat at preſent, but in no wiſe fit to abide.</p>
            <p>There is anſwerably a double Juſtification of the ſecond Creation: One in reſpect of the excellency of its kind, the other is in its keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its kind, it remaining ſtill the ſame in all its motions, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, changes. As it came forth pure from God, ſo it remains pure in it ſelf, acts purely, and is ſtripping it ſelf dayly of that filthy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherewith it is here clothed, as faſt as may be. He who hath this ſeed in him (which ſeed hath Faith and Hope, and every ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual thing in it) <hi>purifieth himſelf as he is pure</hi> from whom it came. As he is pure who begat, ſo it is pure which is begotten by him, and cannot but be contracting inwards, and purging it ſelf from that impurity which cleaves unto it by reaſon of its preſent affinity with fleſh.</p>

            <p>HEre is <hi>the New-Birth</hi> diſtinguiſhed from all other Births which bear any reſemblance to it, and by their ſimilitude may happen to be taken for it.</p>
            <p>There are three ſorts of generations or ways of begetting men in Religion, none of which are this Birth, nor can entitle to that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:165768:25"/>
Sonſhip, or thoſe Priviledges which flow from this Birth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Child thus born.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt way of generation in Religion, is by Blood: So the blood of <hi>Abraham</hi> running along in that line did convey Religion, or at leaſt the Priviledges of that outward Religion which was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed among the Jews: They were <hi>free born,</hi> they were born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Promiſes and Priviledges belonging to that Nation. They were not of the common ſort of the world; but <hi>an holy, a peculiar people,</hi> who were nigh unto God, to whom God was nigh; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the reſt of the world were <hi>aliens and ſtrangers</hi> to him. He was their God ſo as he was not to any elſe, and they were his people ſo as none elſe were: God was to take care of them, their Poſterity, their Land, every thing that belonged to them in an eſpecial maner; They were to ſerve and honour God in a peculiar way, ſo as none elſe were appointed to do, and they might expect that accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God which none elſe could, though doing the ſame things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond way of generation in Religion, is by the fleſhly will of man, by the corrupted, depraved will of man, by the ſelfiſh deſire of man, which naturally enclines to propagate its own Principles, Party, and Intereſt. Thus the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did beget or make <hi>Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> yea <hi>they compaſſed Sea and Land</hi> to do it, as alſo <hi>the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces;</hi> and ſo all ſorts of <hi>Sects</hi> have ever been very induſtrious to ſtrengthen and encreaſe their Party.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a third way of generation, and that is by the honeſt, plain, ſimple, down-right, ingenuous will of man, which for no by-ends, but meerly in reference to the good of man, deſires and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to change him from thoſe corrupt principles, which come into the world with all, and grow up in all, into principles and practiſes of juſtice and order, of righteouſneſs and love both towards God and man. This is the will of man, of man ſo far as he is undepraved, which naturally he enclines to, cannot but ſtrive after, and be very earneſt to bring others unto alſo, as being very ſenſible that it tends both to his and their happineſs, whereas all other things tend appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly to the miſery and deſtruction of the creature. And herein lieth the excellency of man, this is the beſt he can deſire or hope to attain, and a Birth to or in this, is the beſt Birth that can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:165768:25"/>But this is not <hi>the new-birth,</hi> this is not that which God calls <hi>Regeneration;</hi> this is not <hi>the heir,</hi> but <hi>the ſon of the bond-woman,</hi> which ſhall never inherit; this is but the fruit, but the off-ſpring of <hi>the first Adam,</hi> which is <hi>of the earth, earthly,</hi> not of <hi>the ſecond Adam,</hi> which is <hi>the Lord from Heaven,</hi> heavenly in himſelf, and begetting an heavenly nature.</p>
            <p>All theſe come from man, the nature of man, the blood of man, the deſire and skill of man, the corruption of man, or at beſt the excellency of man: But the Child here ſpoken of, the Child God delights in, the Child he will own as his Son, is of his own Seed, is begotten by himſelf, is born of him. He is of the Seed of Eternity, of Immortality, and therefore Eternity of right belongeth to him. He is the Child of God by a new Nature, by a new Life, he is the immediate off-ſpring of his own Son, formed by his own Spirit. <hi>But of God.</hi> This whole Birth belongs to God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is he that ſows this Seed in the heart, the ſeed of this Life, his own Seed, the Seed wherein the very Godhead is contained, and which cannot but grow up into God. God hath his Power to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, as well as man and the other creatures, he hath his Seed to ſow as well as they, and his Seed doth a truly and fully contain his Nature, as their ſeed doth theirs. He is the great Sower that ſows his own grain in his own Vineyard: He is the great Builder that lays the foundation of his own Houſe; <hi>He hath begotten us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is he that quickens the Seed, and cauſeth it to grow; <hi>And you hath he quickened who were dead in trespaſſes and ſins, Eph.</hi> 2. He caſts a vail of death upon Eternity, upon Immortality for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he maketh it, as it were, to rot in the heart, that he may quicken it again, that he may cauſe it to grow up in its own ſhape and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And when it ſhoots forth, it is he that cauſeth it to thrive and flouriſh; <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollos water, but God giveth the increaſe;</hi> This Life floweth only from God, and groweth up only by the breath of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He doth this by his own Power, by his mighty Arm; He puts his whole ſtrength to it. It doth not coſt him nothing to ſow this Seed, to beget this Son, but it coſts him <hi>the very Power and ſtrength of the Godhead,</hi> even an <hi>exceeding greatneſs of Power;</hi> he works with <hi>the very might of his Power</hi> when he begets this Child, when
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:165768:26"/>
he brings forth Faith in this Child, even with the very ſame ſtrain of ſtrength that he exerciſed upon Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead, and exalted him above all other power, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19, 20.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He does this alſo by his own Will. The other births are by the power of man, by the will of man; this is as by the Power of God, ſo by the Will of God. He is not at all moved to this by any thing in the creature, by any thing from the creature, but meerly by his own Will, <hi>of his own Will begat he us.</hi> He ſoweth his Seed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Nature, as other things do theirs according to their nature.</p>
            <p>Lo this is the New-Birth. <hi>The Spirit breatheth where he list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi> No man knows whence this breath comes, no man knows whither this breath goes, but it keeps within its own Circuit, which is only known to it ſelf: <hi>Thus is every one that is born of God.</hi>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:165768:26"/>
and in its outwardneſs; its way of Being, of motion (either within or without) of generation, far exceeds that of fleſh, and ſo doth the Child begotten this way; it is of the ſame nature with that which begets it, <hi>That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi> That which is begotten by the Spirit is of a ſpiritual nature, of the ſame nature with himſelf, of the very divine nature, <hi>who hath made us partakers of the divine nature.</hi> He obſerves the Law of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is to beget and encreaſe his own nature and kind, to multiply himſelf. So that this Child is divine, what ever is in this Child, what ever flows from this Child cannot but be divine: <hi>its Faith, its Love, its Hope, its Joy, its Meekneſs, Sweetneſs, Holineſs, Righteouſneſs,</hi> are not ſuch as grow in Natures garden, but in <hi>the Paradiſe of God,</hi> and from a more inward and ſpiritual ſeed then is ſown in nature. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh:</hi> All the excellency that man can attain to, all the Faith, Hope, Love, Joy, &amp;c. that man can have from any of the Births fore-mentioned, is but fleſhly, but weak, corrupt, fading; but that which is born of the Spirit, that which flows from this Life, that which grows out of this Seed, is ſpiritual, and hath the Spirit of Life, Eternity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fleſh profiteth nothing;</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks that to perſons who were bending their whole ſtrength to underſtand him, all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails nothing: The greateſt fleſhly deſire moves not God, the greateſt fleſhly induſtry and endeavour furthers not the creature. What ever is thus received, what ever is thus underſtood, what ever is thus obtained, is but fleſhly, and will not avail. All the faith in God, all the love towards God, all the deſire after God, or delight in him, all the obedience unto God thus gained, thus put forth, hath no true life in it, and muſt needs wither, and come to nothing. The fleſhly underſtanding of any thing revealed by Chriſt is of no value; <hi>It is the Spirit that quickeneth:</hi> It is the ſpiritual part in the Word, the ſpiritual part of the Word engrafted by the Spirit in the heart, that quickeneth it at firſt, or cauſeth it afterwards to thrive and grow.</p>
            <p>This Child hath a generoſity, a nobility, an height, an aſpiring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in him. He can never reſt out of his own Country, nor out of his own place of habitation in his Country: He cannot endure to live beneath himſelf. He muſt poſſeſs and enjoy God to the full,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:165768:27"/>
or he is not ſatisfied. He muſt live at the full height of <hi>Majesty, Power, Greatneſs and Glory,</hi> or his Life does not pleaſe him; he will hardly own it as Life till it arrive at that. It is <hi>the ſeed of the Kingdom,</hi> and it will never leave ſhooting up till it grow into the Kingdom; till <hi>all the Light,</hi> till <hi>all the Life,</hi> till <hi>all the Power, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Greatneſs and Majeſty of God</hi> that was ſown in it, ſpring up in it, flouriſh, and expatiate it ſelf to the full. And then when this Spirit comes to its full ſtature, when it is ſo united to the Lord as to become perfectly one with that which begat it, it will come to it ſelf, be it ſelf, and enjoy it ſelf: Having attained to that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it was appointed, and to which its nature did aſpire, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually reach towards, it will enter into perfect reſt, into that reſt which is prepared for it only, and which it alone is capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending.</p>

            <p>Man hath the Principle of Knowledg in him, but he is trained up by Inſtruction, and learns no more but as he is taught, either by the dilating of that Principle in himſelf, or from men: So is it with this new Nature; The new-man learneth what it teacheth him within, or what Chriſt teacheth him from without, from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in this ſence; though his Teachings are inward. Chriſt ſpeaks within, but he ſpeaks from without. He doth not onely draw forth that life within, but from without he adds more life. As he does give out of himſelf the ſeed and principle of life whereby he comes to be ſown and grow up in another, ſo he gives out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf likewiſe that food, that vertue, that nouriſhment whereby that life lives, thrives, flouriſheth. The Word of Chriſt upon which the new-man feeds is without, is diſtinct from him (as our food is from us) until it be eaten, concocted, diſtributed, and ſo made perfectly one with him.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is <hi>the Word of God,</hi> and Chriſt hath his Word too. God teacheth Chriſt, Chriſt teacheth us. God teacheth Chriſt by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Nature in him; Chriſt teacheth us by writing his Nature in us. As there is the Nature of God in his Word, ſo there is the Nature of Chriſt in his Word. As God teacheth Chriſt by opening
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:165768:28"/>
his Life and Spirit in him: So Chriſt teacheth us by opening his Life and Spirit in us. God taught him by anointing him, and he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us by anointing us; <hi>Ye have an anointing which teacheth you all things.</hi> As Chriſt is Life and Spirit, ſo he ſpeaketh nothing but what is living and ſpiritual, <hi>The Words which I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life;</hi> and where ever they enter they convey ſpirit and life. Indeed every one cannot receive them, as theſe here could not, they thought to comprehend them by their natural fleſhly underſtanding, which is a principle beneath them, and cannot reach up unto them. As well may a brute underſtand the wiſdom the reaſon of the words of a man, as a man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſpiritual wiſdom of the words of Chriſt. But mans words may have reaſon in them, though the brute underſtand them not; and Chriſts words have <hi>ſpirit and life</hi> in them, though man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it not. Chriſts words are like unto him, truly ſpiritual and living, what ever they appear to man. If he preſcribe a way to man, it is a ſpiritual a living way; If he open any thing of God, it is a true a ſpiritual opening; If he ſpeak peace, it is peace indeed: But there muſt be a principle within to receive this, or elſe it falls to the ground.</p>
            <p>There is a two-fold Word of Chriſt; <hi>a generating, a creating Word,</hi> and <hi>a fructifying Word.</hi> The former there needs no principle to receive, but there he ſpeaks life where there was no life; he onely ſends forth his voyce, ſaying, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> and there is light; <hi>Let there be life,</hi> and there is life. But the fructifying the thriving Word onely takes place where a principle of life is firſt ſown: That cannot be bleſſed with encreaſe and multiplication, which is not, which hath not a Being. Quarrel not therefore, O Man, againſt the Scriptures in this reſpect, becauſe they ſpeak not life to thee, that may be becauſe there is not life in thee, or at leaſt that life at preſent may be ſo nipped, that it may be altogether unable to go forth for or receive in its ſuſtenance.</p>
            <p>

            <p>This food is ſpiritual food, living food, pure food, perfect food, eternal food, food that never waſtes, never corrupts, but abides the ſame for ever. This ſeed, this childe is ſpiritual, eternally living, and ſuch is his food; it grows up with him and in him to eternity;

HE is <hi>poor in ſpirit,</hi> ſtript of all his life, of all his beauty, of all his excellency, of all his wiſdom, of all his ſtrength, of all his righteouſneſs, of all his holineſs, of all his happineſs; a peece of perfect weakneſs, emptineſs, vanity and miſery. He is nothing, he can do nothing: He cannot pray, he cannot beleeve, he cannot wait, he cannot hope, he cannot love, he cannot ſo much as deſire. Indeed when God breathes any of theſe into him, then he has them; when God draws forth any of theſe in him, then he acts them; when God lives in him, then he lives: but of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he is nothing, knows nothing, can do nothing. Other men can reſiſt temptations, but he lies open to all evils: Other men can conquer corruptions, but every thing is too ſtrong for him: Other
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:165768:29"/>
men have a ſtock of duties, of mortification, of holineſs; but he is poor: Other men are ſtrong, but he is weak: Other men cannot but truſt God, love God, live in and upon God; but he ſees, he knows, he feels he can do none of them: He hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his own, nothing in his power, but is ſhut out of all the poſſeſſion and poſsibility of life in himſelf.</p>
            <p>Behold a poor one indeed! There are none elſe ſo poor but they are rich in themſelves, rich in the eſteem, thoughts and conceits of themſelves: But this Soul is emptyed within, as well as without; is ſtript of his inſide, as well as of his outſide; is made naked to purpoſe, his very ſpirit is unclothed, he hath nothing to cover, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or refreſh himſelf even there.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is <hi>of a mournful ſpirit,</hi> cannot but grieve at the ſight and ſenſe of this poverty. As he is the truly poor one, ſo he is the truly afflicted one. As this is the greateſt, the deepeſt poverty; So it pincheth hardeſt, it cauſeth the greateſt, the ſharpeſt ſmart. It over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelms his heart to ſee, how he is <hi>fallen ſhort of the glory of God;</hi> to finde himſelf deſtitute of the life and preſence of God: He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rejoyce while he wants him, who is <hi>the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi> The Primitive Chriſtians indeed had a taſte of joy, but that was from the riches which were then diſpenſed unto them, which did not long laſt; They were poor outwardly, but rich to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; as having nothing, but yet poſſeſsing all in him: but this was no abiding ſtate, <hi>the Bridegroom</hi> was ſoon taken away, and ever ſince hath been a time of mourning.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He is <hi>of a meek ſpirit:</hi> by being continually emptyed, broken and ſtript, he is made very meek. His haughtineſs and roughneſs is tamed and ſubdued by his conſtant ſenſe of miſery. He knows what it is to be miſerable, to be ſubject to vanity, to be deſtitute of the life and power of God. He hath nothing in him to lift up it ſelf againſt any, to accuſe any of. He can neither act roughly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, nor oppoſe any rough actings towards him. He knows the meaning of nothing, and ſo is ſilent and meek towards all and concerning all. He is not a fretful outragious mourner, but he bewails himſelf, and the ſad condition of all things with a meek broken ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He is <hi>hungry and thirſty after Righteouſneſs.</hi> He is very poor, altogether ſtript of them, yet not contented ſo to remain, but there
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:165768:29"/>
is a great hunger and thirſt kindled in him after them. He feels the vanity and miſery of unrighteouſneſs, and would fain be rid of it; he taſtes the ſweetneſs and excellency of righteouſneſs, and is very eager to be filled with it, to be poſſeſſed of it, to have it brought forth in him. It is his own natural temper, and he cannot reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he return into the freedom and fulneſs of it; until he finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but righteouſneſs within, nothing but righteouſneſs flowing forth; perfect righteouſneſs within, perfect righteouſneſs flowing forth, even <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God himſelf</hi> communicated to him, living in him, and diſplaying it ſelf through him. When he is <hi>perfect as his heavenly Father is perfect,</hi> then and not till then will he have enough.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He is very <hi>merciful,</hi> full of compaſſion, of bowels. Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to every creature, merciful to all men, to their Bodies, Souls, to every thing that is liable to ſuffer. He loves no cruelty, no oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but would fain have all tendered, all pityed, all relieved. He is touched with every ones want, and would fain have them ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: He would not have the Bodies of men want food or ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; He would not have the Souls of men want God, the life of God, ſatisfaction in and from God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He is <hi>pure in heart.</hi> Though he is overſpred and covered with abundance of filth and impurity, yet the principle of life in him is pure, and uncapable of being tainted.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He is <hi>a peace-maker,</hi> does not love quarrels and contentions, but meekneſs and quietneſs. There ſhould be no fallings out, no jarrings between Creature and Creature, or between God and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if he could help it: and he is ſtill making peace ſo far as lies in his reach. He loves peace exceedingly, and becauſe of his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant delight to reap it, he is ever ſowing and cheriſhing it. He is the very <hi>Image of his Father</hi> ſtill moving and working towards Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He is <hi>perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake,</hi> for that righteouſneſs, ſweetneſs, meekneſs, &amp;c. that God bringeth forth in him. There is no cauſe why he ſhould be perſecuted, but yet he is perſecuted, and this kinde of temper layeth him open to perſecution (the Dove-like Lamb-like ſpirit is a temptation to the Hawk, to the Wolf.) Chriſt was perſecuted for this very cauſe, and the ſame ſpirit in the world that perſecuted Chriſt will alſo be ſtill perſecuting ſuch as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:165768:30"/>
theſe upon the ſame ground, and ſpeaking <hi>all manner of evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them falſly,</hi> for Chriſts ſake, becauſe of their reference and likeneſs to Chriſt, whom by a ſecret antipathy the ſpirit of the world (when moſt refined and ſpiritualized) cannot but oppoſe. They cannot for ſhame (before men, and in their own ſpirits) ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe things in them, therefore they invent lyes and falſhoods, that they may repreſent them odious to men and their own ſpirits thereby, and ſo more freely, without check of Conſcience, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them under colour thereof.</p>
            <p>But theſe, notwithſtanding all their preſent miſeries and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, though they be looked upon as the <hi>ſcum and off-ſcouring of the world,</hi> and ſo uſed by the world, yet they are <hi>the bleſſed of God, of whom the world is not worthy.</hi> A dram of their life is worth a thouſand worlds. They are bleſſed in their likeneſs unto Chriſt, bleſſed in their preſent communion with Chriſt, in their fellowſhip in his death and ſufferings, and ſhall appear to be bleſſed when they are taken up into his glory, and come to inherit both God, Heaven and Earth, in and with him; which he, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lye, hath promiſed them, and hath reſerved for them, and which none ſhall ever come to partake of with them but this way.</p>

                  <p>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your Children: how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</p>
               </q>
            </head>
            <p>NAture, among other of her leſſons, teacheth Parents to be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der over their Children, to give them what is for their good and not for their hurt. While they are babes, unable to chuſe for themſelves, they provide for them what they know needful: when they grow up, and begin to feel what they want, they are ſtill rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to furniſh them with thoſe neceſſaries which Nature directeth them to ſeek to them for.</p>
            <p>God hath his Children, his Children need proviſion, and his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth him to take care of them, to be tender towards them, as well as the nature of man teacheth him.</p>
            <p>That which theſe children chiefly want is <hi>the Spirit of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> to live in them, to dwell with them, to guide them, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten them, to quicken them, to comfort and refreſh them. They came from this Spirit, and all their content lies in union and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with this Spirit, in the preſence and power ot this Spirit in them: <hi>He is their meat, their drink, their light, their life, their ſtrength, their clothes, their houſe, their inheritance, their way, their end, their all.</hi> They are as it were at preſent ſevered from him, as the ſeed is from the body; but they cannot be well till they return into him, and that which they want in the mean time is him to enter
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:165768:31"/>
into and dwell in them: And as they grow up, to any diſtinct un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of themſelves and their ſtate, they feel this want, and are led by their nature to ask accordingly of their Father.</p>
            <p>That which this Childe begs is <hi>the Spirit,</hi> he cares not for any thing elſe. It is that which his Soul, which every part of him wants; it is that which he needs in every motion, in every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He cannot tell how to ſhift any where, how to do any thing without <hi>this Spirit of life.</hi> There is no life more vigorous then this when it lives in this Spirit, nor no life more flags with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To them that ask him.</hi> This Childe asks; it is natural to him to be asking what he wants of the Father; He is taught to ask, and according to the nature and degree of his want. And Oh how he begs for this Spirit, for this <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> He loathes the unclean ſpirit of the world, but he loves and longs for the pure Spirit of the Father. His Nature is pure, and he loves purity: His Nature is ſpirit, and he loves ſpirit; but not every ſpirit, but that ſpirit which is ſuitable to his Nature, the Spirit which he himſelf came from, and for this he cries and groans unto the Father night and day.</p>
            <p>Now there ſeems to be a great hardneſs in God to part with this Spirit unto them, which may be gathered out of this queſtion here, and may be further confirmed by their experience: for though they cry hard for him, they obtain little of him; little of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, little of his power, little of his comfort. They are ever and anon complaining that they have not ſufficient of him to rub on with. They do not onely want the delight of his preſence, but they have hardly enough to keep life and ſoul together, hardly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of Gods Spirit to keep life in their ſpirits.</p>
            <p>But for all this, there is a great propenſity in God to furniſh them with his Spirit, with ſo much as their preſent ſtate needs; though not with ſo much to their ſence, yet with ſo much to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg: <hi>How much more ſhall your heavenly Father, &amp;c.</hi> He is not an heavenly Father for nothing, but is as ready to give heavenly good things, as earthly Parents are to give earthly good things. <hi>How much more?</hi> If your Nature, which is weak, derived, which came from him, teach you to carry your ſelves thus towards your children; how much more ſhall his Nature, which is ſtrong, which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:165768:31"/>
is the Fountain of Strength and Perfection, teach him to empty his Goodneſs into his Children according to their need? <hi>If ye being evil know how to give good gifts, &amp;c.</hi> If your nature thus prevail to inſtruct you who are corrupted, and in whom it is corrupted; how much more ſhall his pure, his heavenly, his incorruptible Nature teach him tender-heartedneſs towards his Children? How much more ſhall it encline him to give, not outward things, earthly things, but heavenly things, and that heavenly thing which they all want, which is his own Spirit. <hi>Be ſilent, O Senſe, Be confounded, O Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi> who art ſtill witneſſing the contrary in our ſpirits: We ſee not, we feel not, we taſte not, we apprehend not God or any of his Ways aright through thee.</p>

            <head>A ſtrange Occurrence, which may befall this Darling of God and of Chriſt, in his pilgrimage and travel towards his native Country, hidden in a Parable, <bibl>

               </bibl>
            </head>
            <p>IN which Parable there are ſeveral ſtrange things, covertly held forth or repreſented to that eye, which is taught and enabled to pierce into them under a vail.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is <hi>the ſickneſs and death of one dearly beloved of Christ, he whom he loved was ſick:</hi> His love was ſo great to him, that he was known to be an eſpecial object of it. Chriſt, who cured others, had power enough to have preſerved him in health if he had pleaſed, or to have recovered him at a diſtance; but for all Chriſts Love and Power <hi>Lazarus</hi> falls ſick, and his ſickneſs tends
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:165768:32"/>
unto that which we count and call death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The true cauſes of his death,</hi> which were, Chriſts neglect, and an hidden deſign of glory to God, and love to him. (I reckon not his ſickneſs as any, that was but an inſtrument, an engine, ſo inferior a cauſe as it deſerves not to come in number with theſe.)</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſts neglect, and that was very great, Verſ. 6. <hi>When he had heard therefore that he was ſick, he abode two days ſtill in the ſame place where he was.</hi> Though he had notice of it, and that in the moſt pathetical maner that could be, the news was directed to his heart, and ſo directed as it might beſt touch and wound his heart, <hi>Behold, he whom thou loveſt is ſick:</hi> There is one whom thou haſt profeſſed and born much love to, he now ſtands in need of thy love, of the putting forth of thy love for his relief, he wants thy help, <hi>behold he is ſick.</hi> When he hears this, he ſtirs not one ſtep, but ſtays ſtill where he was two days together, as if he would be ſure to give him time enough to dye.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another cauſe of his death was an hidden deſign of glory to God. <hi>This ſickneſs is not unto death, but for the glory of God: that the Son of God might be glorified thereby,</hi> Verſ. 4. I know the meaning of this ſickneſs, it ſhall not end in death, but that death it muſt lead to ſhall be as it were no death, it ſhall be ſo ſoon and ſo powerfully ſwallowed up in life; <hi>But for the glory of God,</hi> for the advancing of the glory of that Power and Love of his which this ſhall occaſion the putting forth and diſcovery of in his Son; <hi>that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was alſo a deſign of love to <hi>Lazarus;</hi> that he might gain a further teſtimony, a further ſight, a further experiment of the Love and Power of Chriſt, that he might receive and enjoy a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of life from Chriſt. God doth not meerly uſe us as Inſtruments for his own Glory, but he loves that we ſhould have a taſte of that Glory he raiſes to himſelf out of us: He brings us to ſickneſs, to death, to deſtruction, not only to exerciſe his skill and power in healing, in raiſing, in reſtoring us; but that he might alſo cauſe a more ſweet freſh health, a more precious flouriſhing life, a more pure perfect Salvation to ſpring up out of that ſickneſs, out of that death, out of the aſhes of that deſtruction.</p>
            <p>There was another deſign yet in it, which had alſo an influence upon it, and that was the confirmation of the Faith of the Diſciples.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:165768:32"/>
So Verſ. 14.15. <hi>Lazarus is dead, and I am glad for your ſakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe.</hi> God had an intent, beſides the glory of the Work, to confirm the Faith of the Diſciples. <hi>Miracles</hi> can neither work nor confirm Faith, they cannot reach that Principle whence Faith ſprings and grows; but God can either work or confirm faith by them. All the Miracles that ever Chriſt wrought could not bring any one to beleeve, but they ſtill ask for <hi>a ſign,</hi> theſe were not evidencing and convincing enough; but yet God made uſe of every one of them when, and to whom, and as he pleaſed. He who hath an eye may ſee the Power of God in every thing, and may obſerve the ſeveral eminent putings forth of it, and ſo be ſtrengthened in his Faith towards him; but he who hath not this eye can only toſs it up and down in his own uncertain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, but not ſpiritually diſcern it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I am glad for your ſakes.</hi> He was not glad of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s ſickneſs, of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s miſery, of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s death; but he was glad of the advantage it yeelded him to ſet forth God, the Glory of God, to make <hi>Lazarus</hi> taſte of his Love and his Power, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Faith of his weak ſtaggering Diſciples, in this reſpect he was glad of it. God delights not ſimply in miſery, in death, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; but in that which he works by them, and out of them, which could not ſo advantagiouſly any other way be brought forth and diſcovered as through them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is <hi>the ſad lamentation over dead Lazarus:</hi> The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of <hi>the Jews,</hi> of his <hi>kindred,</hi> of the <hi>Diſciples;</hi> but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the lamentation of <hi>Martha and Mary</hi> is very obſervable, Verſ. 21, &amp; 32. <hi>Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not dyed.</hi> Wherein they ſecretly tax him for his neglect, for his delay; as if they had ſaid; Lord, we ſent to thee ſoon enough, and if thou hadſt come, we had not now been thus mourning and weeping over our dead brother, thou mighteſt eaſily have prevented all this if thou hadſt pleaſed; <hi>Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not dyed.</hi> And this is the language of the poor deſolate Soul, of the poor dead ſpirit; Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my life had not gone out; If thou hadſt ſtood by me, and ſtuck to me, and put forth thy skill and power for me (as I thought thy love to me would have enforced thee to do) I had never taſted this cup of deſolation, this cup of death. O it is the abſence of Chriſt that kills the Soul,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:165768:33"/>
whoſe Life is in his preſence!</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The unexpectedneſs of any reſtauration of him to life.</hi> The <hi>Diſciples,</hi> it never enters into their thoughts, but <hi>let us go and dye with him,</hi> V. 16. The <hi>Jews</hi> wonder that Chriſt (loving him ſo well) did not preſerve him from dying, but never once thought of raiſing of reſtoring him to life, Verſ. 37. <hi>Martha,</hi> who ſeemed to be full of Faith in this very reſpect, Verſ. 22. was ſo far from it, that ſhe even mocks at Chriſt that he ſhould make any offer to go about it: Verſ. 39 <hi>Lord, by this time he ſtinketh, for he hath been dead four days.</hi> If thou hadſt come ſooner thou mighteſt have preſerved him from death, but now it is too late to think of any thing, he is not in a caſe now to be viſited or recovered, <hi>by this time he ſtinketh,</hi> what doſt thou mean to ſpeak of taking away the ſtone? Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from death is very unexpected: He that is ſhut up in the grave ſeemeth quite out of the capacity of life. In miſery, in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there may be hope of relief, but who can look for <hi>Redemption from death, to be raiſed out of the grave?</hi> Alas, we little think ever to meet with any ſuch grave, much leſs to be redeemed from it! Chriſt was thy Type herein (though ſomewhat more alſo:) Thou muſt taſte of <hi>his Death,</hi> thou muſt into <hi>his Grave,</hi> and lie there thy ſeaſon, though <hi>the holy One</hi> in thee ſhall not <hi>ſee corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Thy life ſhall not dye, ſhall not not there, it ſhall but ſleep; and when thou awakeſt, thou ſhall <hi>awake in his likeneſs,</hi> and live for ever. As Chriſt was raiſed from the dead to dye no more, <hi>for death to have no more dominion over him,</hi> ſo ſhalt thou: Thou ſhalt ſit on the Throne with him; and that life, which hath been hitherto in weakneſs, in bonds, in ſlavery, in miſery, paſſing through and bearing the weight of death and deſtruction, ſhall then reign, ſhall then enjoy it ſelf in the Fountain from whence it did flow, and where alone it can ſweetly and perfectly live.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The great Love and Power Chriſt ſhewed in recovering him to life.</hi> There was great Love, which he variouſly expreſſed, both in diſregarding himſelf and his own ſafety in going thither, which his Diſciples put him in mind of, verſ. 8. and in his behaviour when he came there. His affection vented it ſelf exceedingly, ſo that <hi>the Jews</hi> could not but take notice of his <hi>great Love</hi> to him, verſ. 36. <hi>He groaned and troubled himſelf,</hi> verſ. 33. <hi>He wept,</hi> verſ. 35. It went to his Heart, it melted his very Soul to ſee the condition of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:165768:33"/>
his beloved one. O the various workings in the Heart of Chriſt! He can weep and rejoyce over the ſame thing: how ſorrowful doth he here expreſs himſelf at that which he told the Diſciples he was glad of: It afflicts him to ſee his people in miſery, in perplexity, in the hands of death, and yet he rejoyceth to behold what he meaneth to work for his Father, himſelf and them out of it. <hi>He groans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain very deeply <hi>in himſelf,</hi> verſ. 38. (He did not make a ſhew of ſorrow and groaning, but it was inward, in his heart,) and he prays for him, and ſets his ſtrength to deliver him; he both calls upon God for his ſtrength, and puts forth that ſtrength of God that was in himſelf; <hi>He cryed with a loud voyce, Lazarus, come forth,</hi> Verſ. 43. He ſpake with Life and Power mightily; He who was <hi>the Reſurrection and the Life,</hi> gave an evidence of it, for he ſpake Reſurrection and Life with his lips; he ſent forth his raiſing and living Power, and it did raiſe and beget life.</p>
            <p>This is the only way to cure ſuch as enter into this ſtate of death, into the grave of Chriſt; they muſt be raiſed by the very ſame Power wherewith Chriſt was raiſed; Nothing beneath that will avail to effect it; the death that binds them, the grave that holds them under, will eaſily maſter any thing elſe. It is not uſing of means that can relieve them, they are dead, they are beneath the uſe of means, <hi>they have loſt all life and knowledg in the grave,</hi> they know no means, they can uſe no means, they can ſtir no way, they can move no more then a dead man. Nor indeed are there any means appointed for them, or to be uſed by them, Spiritual means are as improper, and will prove as ineffectual in this ſtate of ſpiritual death, as natural means would uſed towards a man naturally dead. That Light, that Life, whereby they knew, whereby they acted, being dead and buried, they cannot ſtir nor move, they are in no capacity either of knowing, uſing, or receiving benefit from any means. That <hi>Eternal Life, Love, Power</hi> that at firſt quickened them, that at firſt brought them forth, by whoſe withdrawing from them, and leaving them for a ſeaſon (as he had done Chriſt before, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi>) they were brought to this ſtate, muſt come again himſelf to the grave, and raiſe them up by the very ſame Power of Life, if ever they live more.</p>

               <hi>I am the good Shepherd.</hi> Chriſt had been ſpeaking of three things in the beginning of the Chapter: Of <hi>the door of the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, the Door-keeper,</hi> and <hi>the Shepherd.</hi> The firſt and the laſt he challengeth to himſelf, <hi>I am the Door,</hi> ſaith he, verſ. 9. <hi>I am the good Shepherd,</hi> ſaith he here; and the ſecond belongeth to him alſo, he is the <hi>Door-keeper</hi> who opens and ſhuts the door.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt is the Door.</hi> There is a door at which Chriſt enters into us, and that we are to open to Chriſt, <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the door and knock, if any man open to me, &amp;c.</hi> and there is a Door at which we enter into the Father, <hi>which Door is Christ.</hi> We are the Seed of the Father ſown in a ſtrange Land, and we return by Chriſt unto our own home. There is no other Door but this to enter into the Kingdom and Boſom of the Father by.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt is the Door-keeper,</hi> he it is that opens this Door, and lets in the Sheep at this Door; he hath <hi>the Key of David, who opens, and none ſhuts, and ſhuts, and none opens.</hi> He ſet the Door open to that Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.8. He turns the Key, and lets in the Soul into ſpiritual Light, Life and Truth: and he who gets in by any other means, he who gets ſpiritual Myſteries opened to him before Chriſt opens them, he comes not into them aright, nor will he be advantaged in the life of his ſpirit thereby. That Truth alone will do us good, which Chriſt by his Spirit opens to us, and leads us into.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He is the Shepherd, the great Shepherd of the Sheep,</hi> the Maſter-Shepherd. He is the only Shepherd to the Univerſal Flock, that never had any Shepherd but him: <hi>The Kings, the Prieſts, the Prophets of old,</hi> they were only typical Shepherds to that typical Kingdom and People of <hi>Iſrael: The Officers of Churches</hi> were only Shepherds to a few particular Congregations, ſome to one, ſome to another: <hi>The Apostles</hi> roſe a ſtep higher, they were Shepherds o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Churches at that time in the World, though ſome of them had a more peculiar charge over the Jews, as <hi>Peter;</hi> ſome a more peculiar charge over the Gentiles, as <hi>Paul.</hi> But none of theſe were <hi>Maſter-Shepherds,</hi> but all under Chriſt as his Servants. He is the only Shepherd of the Univerſal Flock, and the Head-Shepherd of every little Flock; in whom all the Light and Life doth dwell, and from whom it doth ſpring forth to them, who ſpeaks in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Shepherds, and to whom the greateſt Shepherds are but Sheep.</p>

               <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt:) <hi>No man cometh unto the Father but by me. I am the</hi> ſpiritual <hi>Way,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I my ſelf, and wherein all ſpirits walk towards God: <hi>I am the Truth,</hi> the Light that leads all in this Way: <hi>I am the Life</hi> that quickens and enables all to follow this Light in this Way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am the Way.</hi> It is by entering into me that a man enters into the Way, and by walking in me a man walks in the Way. Out of Chriſt, and quite out of the way to the Father: ever in Chriſt, and ever in the Way. <hi>Every branch that abideth in him</hi> is in the way of growing in the Light and Life of God, and of bringing forth fruit unto God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am the Truth.</hi> It is in Chriſt we have the true Light, <hi>the Lord ſhall be a Light unto thee:</hi> They are the ſpiritual Beams of Truth that flow from Chriſt which only guide us to God. All the light of this world, all the light of reaſon is but darkneſs, and leads a man further and further from the Father; Chriſt is our Light when ever we are led to the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am the Life.</hi> All the quickenings and warmings we have any where but from Chriſt, never lead us to God: it is only the Life of him in us that moves us and guides us truly and aright to him. Every motion, but what we have from Chriſt, is a dead motion, there is no true life in it: <hi>in him we live, and move, and have our ſpiritual Being.</hi> We are out of the way, dark and dead naturally, and all the helps of nature and art help but to lead us more out of the way, to increaſe our wanderings, darkneſs and death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: God hath made Chriſt unto us our Way, and our Light, and our Life; when ever we come to the Father we come in him as our Path, lighted by him who is that Truth that never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, quickened and animated with him who is that Life that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fails.</p>

               <hi>I am the good Shepherd.</hi> He is not only a Shepherd, but <hi>the Shepherd,</hi> not only the Shepherd, but <hi>the good Shepherd.</hi> He taketh care of the Sheep, he maketh a Fold to keep the Sheep ſafe in, he looketh to every one of the Sheep, (<hi>he calleth his own Sheep by name,</hi> verſ. 3.) he leadeth them out, he goeth out before them, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their paſture for them, hath skill (and maketh uſe of it) to feed them, to water them, to preſerve them, to cure them; he ventures his Life for them, yea yeelds it up to reſcue them,

               <hi>And know my ſheep.</hi> I know who they are, I know what they are; I know their nature, I know their names, I know whence they came, I know their very original, I know their preſent ſtate, their preſent ſtrength, their preſent weakneſs; I can tell every one of them, both who they are, and where they are, and what they are, and what they need; there is nothing can befall them, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they can be led or driven into, but I underſtand it, and them in it. It notes Chriſts full underſtanding the ſtate of his ſheep, and his owning and taking care of them in their ſeveral ſtates; <hi>I know mine:</hi> yea the performing every office of ſervice and care that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him concerning them in that ſtate, as if they be ſick or weak or wandering, the Shepherd is then to expreſs ſpecial love and care towards them: The Shepherd is not to neglect or caſt off his ſheep for any ſuch thing, as one who knows not their weakneſs, their fooliſhneſs, their proneneſs to run aſtray, their liableneſs to diſeaſes, &amp;c. but to be the more tender over them, to take the more pains about them, to watch them ſo much the more narrowly, to guard them ſo much the more ſafely. Chriſt will not ſuffer any of his ſheep to miſcarry, <hi>of thoſe which thou haſt given me, I have loſt none. And know my ſheep:</hi> Chriſt knows his ſheep as part of himſelf (as of the ſame nature and life with himſelf) knows how to love and cheriſh them as himſelf, yea can neglect himſelf, his own eaſe and liberty, yea his very life for their ſakes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And am known of mine.</hi> As Chriſt knows his ſheep, ſo his ſheep know him: He knows them as his ſheep, and they know him as their Shepherd: The derived light and life in them knows that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal light in him from whence it came. Hence it is that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but own and ſubmit to him. <hi>They hear his voyce, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>follow him, they will not</hi> ſo much as <hi>harken to the voyce of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:</hi> Let another come with never ſo much learning, with never ſo much skill, with never ſo much light, with never ſo high and myſterious openings of ſpiritual things, they know him not, they cannot receive any thing from him. It is the goat the ſtranger in us that hears the voyce of a ſtranger, but the ſheep never hears any
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:165768:36"/>
voyce but the voyce of Chriſt. It knows none but him, and it knows him very well, and will hear him in every thing he ſpeaketh, will follow him any whither, will take any food any Phyſique from him, will yeeld it ſelf up to him to deal as he will with it in any diſtemper which it is obnoxious to. Theſe ſheep are ever ſatisfied while they are under the eye and in the hands of this Shepherd: They like every thing he makes uſe of towards them; They like his crook whereby he gathers them in when he ſees good unto himſelf, they like the very rod wherewith he ſmites them, they know him ſo well; the ſight the thoughts of them, his uſe of them is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment to them, <hi>thy rod and thy ſtaff comfort me: Pſal.</hi> 23.4.</p>
            <p>This knowledg between Chriſt and them is juſt ſuch a knowledg as is between the Father and him, as it is illuſtrated in the next verſe of this Chapter. It ariſes from ſuch an union, it is heightened by ſuch a communion, nay it is ſuch a kinde of knowledg for nature: We know Chriſt by proceeding from him, and by lying in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and by his opening his ſecrets to us; Thus Chriſt comes to know the Father, and thus we come to know Chriſt. There is the moſt intimate, the moſt clear, the moſt full acquaintance between the Father and Chriſt that can be: Chriſt knows the Father as one with him, as he in whom the Father is written and brought forth. Chriſt ſpeaks much of his knowing the Father, what is it? It is a knowledg that ariſeth from the ſame nature: by the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame nature unto him, he hath his capacity and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of it: by the full revelation of the Father in him he hath his light, and by lying in the boſom of the Father he hath the full uſe of his light to ſee with. There is a kinde of knowledg between Creatures of the ſame nature, and the neerer they are in the line of blood, the better they know one another: There is none comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>the Father and the Son,</hi> they know one another indeed. The firſt act of the Fathers knowledg paſſed upon the Son, and the firſt act of the Sons knowledg paſſed upon the Father, and there it is fulleſt and ſtrongeſt. God knew the Son firſt, and all for his ſake; Chriſt knew the Father firſt, and all for his ſake: Their knowledg is concentred in each other, there they fix it, there they make uſe of it, there they delight in it.</p>
            <p>Juſt ſuch a knowledg, as this, is there between Chriſt and his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:165768:36"/>
ſheep. Chriſt knoweth them as thoſe he himſelf hath begotten, as thoſe whom he hath breathed the Image of the Father into, as thoſe that were taken out of him, as his wife formed out of his own ſide (as <hi>Eve</hi> was out of <hi>Adams:</hi>) They know Chriſt as <hi>the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Father,</hi> as <hi>the Fountain of their life,</hi> as their <hi>onely Lord and Shepherd.</hi> And therefore it is the firſt and moſt natural act of the Soul, ſo ſoon as it is begotten and born, to beleeve on Chriſt, to love Chriſt, to hope in Chriſt: So ſoon as ever it opens its eyes and ſees, it ſees Chriſt the original of its own life; and it clings unto him; all its motions are goings forth of it ſelf towards him, and receiving and letting him into it ſelf: It cannot live further then it enters into Chriſt, or then Chriſt enters into it; this is its proper element where it onely can reſt and delight it ſelf. As Chriſt did hang on the Father from that knowledg he had of him, and the Father did continually communicate himſelf to Chriſt by that knowledg he had of him: So Chriſts ſheep preſently hang on him as their Shepherd ſo ſoon as they are made ſheep, and he naturally taketh care of them as the Father doth of him. Look after what manner, and upon what grounds the Father and Chriſt know one another, and what the effects of this knowledg are; juſt ſuch a knowledg, and ſuch effects of knowledg ſhall you finde between Chriſt and his ſheep.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Knowledg</hi> is the acquaintance perſons have one with another, their comprehending of one another in the ſame light wherein they are and live; wherein they underſtand the diſpoſitions, the ways, the counſels of one another: God is ſaid <hi>not to know</hi> wicked men, becauſe he holds no acquaintance no correſpondence with them; but he knows Chriſt, he holds intimate acquaintance and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him, he lets him ſee what ever is in him, and what ever he intends to do: and ſo Chriſt alſo adviſes with his Father about every thing, deſires to hide nothing from the Father, deſires to know nothing but from, in and with the Father. Such an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is there between Chriſt and his: Chriſt opens his excellencies and the myſteries of his ways to them, and they open their hearts and thoughts and burthens and every thing to Chriſt; it is a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg accompanyed with and begetting the moſt intimate famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity, the moſt mutual communion, delight and confidence.</p>
            <p>And this knowledg onely is certain; all other knowledg, all
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:165768:37"/>
from without, all from within that is any other ways received then from the lips of Chriſt, is but a lye, and cannot but deceive. We know Truth by knowing Chriſt, and it is in and from Chriſt that we know it. Chriſts ſheep cannot take up truth at any time when it is held out, nor from any hand, but onely when they ſee Chriſt going before them: Though they ſee Truth to be their food, yet they deſire it not, they meddle not with it, but when their Shepherd picks it out for them and as he diſtributes it to them. It is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the Devil to be beforehand with Truth, to hold it out firſt on his falſe grounds and principles, that afterwards by felling them he may ſupplant the Truth it ſelf, when Chriſt comes to hold it forth: And though other perſons may take up Truth thus held forth (by drinking in the outward notion) yet they cannot. They do not know this kinde of voyce, they are not uſed to receive things thus from principles, or from the light of Reaſon, after the manner of men; but when Chriſt leads them by his Spirit, when he thus ſpeaks to them, they know his voyce and follow him. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not what Creatures ſpeak in or through the Creation; They regard not what ſpiritual men ſpeak of God or Chriſt, or any other ſpiritual thing; They regard not what is ſpoken within them (they know the root of vanity and deceit is deep within:) But what Chriſt ſpeaks either from within or from without is exceeding wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to them, when he opens that ear and that heart that can hear and know his voyce. And this is their kinde of knowledg, which having once taſted of they are not able to reliſh any other: Chriſt reliſheth no other knowledg in them, nor do they reliſh any other knowledg in themſelves. When this is at any time darkened, hid or buryed from them or within them, though they have never ſo much left of that which men call knowledg, yet they cannot look upon it or own it as knowledg. Such kinde of knowledg is not knowledg with them, is not their knowledg, they have neither intereſt nor delight in it. As Chriſt knows them by his own light, by his own knowledg, by the knowledg of his own divine ſpiritual Nature, ſo they know Chriſt and ſpiritual things by the ſame light, by the ſame nature, with the ſame knowledg: He hath the peculiar knowledg of ſuch a Shepherd as he is, and they have the peculiar knowledg of ſuch ſheep as they are. Their relation is diſtinct, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from any relation in this world, of another nature and kinde,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:165768:37"/>
their union is ſuch an union as is not to be found here below, and ſuch is their knowledg and communion; <hi>I am the good Shepherd, and know my ſheep, and am known of mine.</hi>

            <p>A Covenant with us is that agreement which is concluded of between man and man, between two ſeveral parties: It contains in it the agreement between them, and the terms of the agreement. This is ſown every where in every thing throughout the whole Creation, and in all affairs and tranſactions there may be ſeen and read the force and vertue of a Covenant, written either in open letters or ſecret characters. Every union every relation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a Covenant in it, the bounds whereof makes the union and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſweet, but beyond thoſe limits it is very bitter. And O how ſweetly things go between God and his people within the bounds of his Covenant, but he who paſſes thoſe limits ſhall finde it an evil and a very bitter thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:165768:38"/>God hath two ſeeds to ſow and cauſe to grow up, two earths or wives to conceive and bring forth children to him from the ſeeds ſown in their wombs; and he hath two Covenants, wherein are his terms of agreement (and theirs too, for each ſort readily by their very nature deſire, and cannot but aſſent to the terms of each Covenant) how far, in what reſpect and upon what ground he will own them as his, be with them, be what they deſire unto them.</p>
            <p>Now as theſe ſeeds were in ſeveral ſeaſons to be brought forth and appear; So were theſe wives to be taken and owned, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly were the Covenants to appear, in which reſpect the one is ſaid to be <hi>old</hi> the other <hi>new,</hi> verſ. 13. When God ſpeaks to us, he ſpeaks in a language ſuitable to us, and ſuitable to ſo much of his minde as he intends to expreſs, whereas thoſe very things he ſpeaks to us he can repreſent, open and call otherwiſe. He can call that old which he tells us is new, and that new which he tells us is old, yea and he can confound this language alſo and bring them both to an equality in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>There never was any deep, any wiſe underſtanding of God, nor ever can be, till <hi>the great depths of the Godhead</hi> are broken up; till then God can and may hide himſelf in his whole Being, in every motion, in every thought of his heart, in every word of his mouth. He may ſpeak what he pleaſeth; He may ſpeak one thing now, and in the very next breath ſpeak clean contrary to what he ſpake before, and make both good, and yet make him a lyar that ſpake either from him, or pretended to underſtand him in either. He can call the ſame thing old that he calls new, and the ſame thing new that he calls old. He can call this a new Covenant, and if thou thinkeſt to underſtand him and ſpeak the ſame thing with him, he can tell thee thou art a lyar, and call it an old Covenant: If thou wilt fall in with him here and ſay with him 'tis old, he can confound thee here alſo and ſay 'tis both new and old: If thou thinkeſt thou canſt comprehend him in this, he can confound thee yet again and ſay 'tis neither new nor old: If thou wilt yet be wiſe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand both how 'tis new and how 'tis old, and how neither new nor old, he can and will confound thee again and ſhew thee that thou art now the greateſt fool of all. That very underſtanding which was made by the Lord, enlightened by him, made wiſe to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:165768:38"/>
know him, muſt be darkened and confounded again. A deep wiſe man can order his words ſo as others ſhall think they know him by them, yet ſhall not, but he alone underſtand and comprehend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: When he will he can open himſelf to the underſtanding of the meaneſt, and when he will he can hide himſelf from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the deepeſt: He can open himſelf in his deepeſt myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and he can hide himſelf in his plaineſt conceptions of things; and this is an excellent peece of skill to be able to open and hide as one pleaſes. Wilt thou deny to God this skill, O Man? Or if he have it, wilt thou deny him liberty to make uſe of it? Wilt thou ſay, that if he ſpeak to thee, he muſt ſpeak to thee ſo as thou mayſt underſtand him? Or if he ſpeak that which ſeemeth plain to thy Reaſon, wilt thou preſently conclude that thou doſt ſee and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him? O the boldneſs of man who will be meaſuring the minde of God in his words, and ſay thus far muſt his meaning go and no further! To what an height doth every ſort of men raiſe their <hi>own Babylon</hi> (ſome out of the Scriptures, ſome out of inward Revelations) comprehending <hi>God, Chriſt, Life, Bleſſedneſs</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their line! But the building doth no where come to perfection, nor ever ſhall; for before it doth or can, confuſion ſhall overtake it, and the City alone ſhall ſtand <hi>whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi> That which God ſpeaks ſhall ſtand for Truth onely as he opens, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo far as he opens it: and man ſhall one day ſee (let him be as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident now as he will) that he never underſtood one jot or tittle of God in the plaineſt thing that ever he did or ſpake.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>For this is the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael, after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a Covenant to be made, to be eſtabliſhed between God and his People, which hath not been as yet. <hi>I will make,</hi> but I have not yet made. The ſeed are to be brought forth, but they have not as yet been brought forth; and the Covenant is to be made and ſet up, but hath not as yet been made and ſet up. There is a Covenant that hath been already made, <hi>an old Covenant,</hi> a Covenant of works, of labor and toyl, of bondage, ſlavery, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wrath, death: And there is a Covenant to be made, <hi>a new Covenant,</hi> a Covenant of Reſt, of Liberty, of Love, <hi>of Life and Peace evermore;</hi> (God hath his ſeveral ſorts of things to bring forth and ſet in an excellent order one by another.) And <hi>this</hi> is it,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:165768:39"/>
it contains this in it, this is the deſcription of it which here follows, <hi>this is the Covenant that I will make.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>With the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> What is here meant by <hi>the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> whether the natural <hi>ſeed of Abraham,</hi> (which were ſo in one ſence) or the ſpiritual <hi>ſeed of Chriſt,</hi> (which were ſo in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſence) or both, (for though they have hitherto been ſeparated, yet the ſhadow and the ſubſtance may one day be gathered into one) I ſhall not now declare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After thoſe days ſaith the Lord.</hi> After the days of their viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deſtruction and deſolation ſhall be ended, after he hath plucked up both the natural ſeed and the ſpiritual ſeed, and hath done break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down deſtroying and afflicting them, after that then will he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to raiſe them up, to build and to plant them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.28. And when the time of reſtitution, when the time of refreſhing, when the time of this ſeeds ſpringing up anew (with its new-purified life) comes, then ſhall this new Covenant appear, then will I make this Covenant with them, <hi>ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will put my Laws into their minde. Their minde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The minde is the inward part of the man, the underſtanding part wherein the light of the man lies: it is that wherein the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of light or darkneſs, of life or death are ſown. The conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of man, the ſtate of man is according to his minde, the changes wrought in man one way or other is by an efficacy upon his minde; the minde being changed the man is changed, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not; Man would in all changes remain the ſame, if his minde were not changed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Laws.</hi> Laws are Rules of Government. In every King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, City, Society there are or at leaſt ſhould be Laws for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and governing of them: God hath his Laws, which are his Rules, whereby he would have both the minde and the body, the inward and outward man guided in every thing. A Law is a Rule for ſuch or ſuch an action: God hath his rules for every action; for every action of worſhip, of obedience, for the whole courſe and converſation, and thoſe that do not obey him are called <hi>unruly men, ſons of Belial,</hi> that come not under his yoke. He hath his Laws for us in every condition, for every motion in every condition, what we ſhould turn from, what we ſhould turn towards, how, in what degree, by what light, by what power, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:165768:39"/>
               <hi>I will put my Laws into their minds. I will put,</hi> or <hi>I will give;</hi> I will beſtow them upon the mind for a gift. I will dip their minds into my Laws, or I will put my Laws within their minds: My Laws ſhall be the quality or qualification of their minds, I will make their minds ſavour and reliſh of all my Laws; it ſhall be <hi>the Ark</hi> to keep them in, that they ſhall not be to ſeek when they ſhould come to obey them, and guide their actions by them, for they ſhall lie within their underſtanding; They ſhall not need to ſay, <hi>Who ſhall go up to Heaven to bring the Will of God down to us?</hi> but they ſhall find his Will (their Rule) in their own minds. <hi>I will put my Laws into their minds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And write them in their hearts. The heart</hi> is the ſeat, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of life and motion; the inward principle of life is there: It is the place where life dwells, &amp; whence life goes forth into the whole man, and every motion and action of the man. <hi>Writing</hi> notes a ſolemn putting in, a clear putting in, a durable putting in; it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth ſomewhat more to us then the former phraſe: The other was given as it were by word of mouth, this by writing, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the heart, that the heart may have recourſe to it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, nay it is written in and upon the heart, that the heart cannot chuſe but know it, that if the light of the underſtanding ſhould at any time fail, yet the holy inclination of the will ſhould preſerve it pure. <hi>And write them in their hearts:</hi> He will not only put them into their mind, that they may have a force upon their reaſon and underſtanding, but he will make them take a deep impreſſion upon their hearts too, he will write them there.</p>
            <p>There are two things make men miſcarry; <hi>the darkneſs of their underſtandings, and the perverſneſs of their wills.</hi> God under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to heal both in this <hi>New Covenant:</hi> He will put his Laws into their mind to be a Light there, and he will write them in their hearts to be a Guide there, to have the firſt motion in, and upon, and from the principle of life, ſo that the heart ſhall never move, but it ſhall have the tincture and force of the Law going forth in it. Though a man ſhould have the Law put into his mind, and know clearly what the will of God is; yet his heart may ſtand at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from it. (It is one thing to make a man know the will of God, and another thing to encline his will to it.) The heart will not always follow the law of the underſtanding, but ſometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:165768:40"/>
the rule of its own crookedneſs; therefore God will rectifie that too, that it ſhall not have a crooked Law within in it ſelf, but a right Rule to guide it by; that whatſoever the will and affections encline to ſhall be ſuitable to the Law: that as now the heart clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with nothing but what is ſuitable to its own perverſneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Law of Sin is written there; ſo then the heart ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to nothing but what is ſuitable to Gods Holineſs, becauſe the Law of his Life is written there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtill complains of the heart, and tells us that <hi>out of the heart proceeds all evil,</hi> there lies the root and ſtrength of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: Our underſtandings indeed are bad, but our hearts are worſe. Now God, intending to cure us by this New Covenant, doth not only take order about the underſtanding, but eſpecially about the heart; <hi>I will put my Laws into their mind, and in their hearts will I write them,</hi> as the words may ſomewhat more forcibly and ſignificantly be rendered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This phraſe is very full, denoting not only the Relation, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the filling up of the Relation between God and his People on both ſides. He doth not ſay, I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People, for ſo God always was, even in the time of his greateſt eſtrangedneſs from them; and ſo they always were, even in their greateſt bondage and captivity: but <hi>I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a People.</hi> I will become a God to them, and they ſhall become a people to me: I will act towards them as their God, and they ſhall act towards me as my people: I and they will both walk anſwerably to the relation that is between us: I will walk towards them juſt as a God ſhould towards his people, and they ſhall walk towards me juſt as a people ſhould towards their God: When this Covenant comes to take place, their own hearts ſhall feel, and all that look upon our mutual walking ſhall know, that I am their God, and they my people. There ſhall no fault be to be found in either of our carriages towards the other, but in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing <hi>I will</hi> (as becomes me) <hi>be to them a God, and they ſhall</hi> in every thing (as it behoves them alſo) <hi>be to me a people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will be to them a God.</hi> To be a God implies two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To be full of all things,</hi> to be the Fountain of Fulneſs, to be and enjoy every thing (the Perfection of every thing) in himſelf.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:165768:40"/>
They are degrees of wiſdom, power, holineſs, goodneſs, &amp;c. that are communicated to creatures, but the Fulneſs of theſe is proper to God: He is the Fountain whence all theſe iſſue; he is the great Sea out of which all waters flow, into which they return, and in which they live their own life: 'Tis a weak, a creaturely life they enjoy in their going forth, it is a true, a full, a perfect Life they enjoy in their return.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To take care of all things.</hi> God is the great Owner of all, to him it properly belongs to take care of all. The Heathen, when they make gods, they attribute and commit to them the care of themſelves, and of every thing. Care, it belongs to the Maſter of the Family, to the Head, to the Governor. The care of all things lies upon God, it belongs to his place, it is proper to him, it is his due, yea (let me ſpeak a little freely) it is his duty, it is that which he owes to every thing that came from him.</p>
            <p>Now God <hi>will be a God to them,</hi> that is. Firſt, He will be Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them, he will be the Fountain of all Perfection in them, he will lay out all his Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Power and Love for them. He will not only be their God, in giving them a right to theſe, an intereſt in theſe; but he will be a God to them in employing and improving theſe for them, that they ſhall have as great a ſhare in them, and as great a freedom in the uſe of them, as any man can have in that that is his moſt proper poſſeſſion: that as God is a God to himſelf, ſtill laying out his Wiſdom, Power, &amp;c. for himſelf; ſo he will be a God to them, he will never ſpare any of them when they have occaſion to uſe them; they ſhall have as free and as full uſe of every thing he has, as he himſelf has: The ſame Fulneſs that dwells in himſelf, and is enjoyed by himſelf, ſhall dwell in them, and be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by them: What he is in himſelf, he will be in them and to them. <hi>I will be to them a God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then ſecondly, God <hi>will be a God to them</hi> in his care over them. He will take as exact care of them as a Maſter does of his family, as a King does of his people, yea as he does of himſelf, and what belongs to himſelf. As he taketh care of himſelf, of his own Glory, that it be preſerved and flouriſh, ſo will he take care of them in every reſpect; of their ſtanding, growing, thriving, &amp;c. that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hurt them, that every thing advance their happineſs: And well he may, <hi>for they are himſelf, the children that came out of his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:165768:41"/>
own loyns, the Wife that came out of his own ſide;</hi> they were one at firſt in the ſtraiteſt union and conjunction, they are one ſtill even as much as ever they were, (their preſent ſeparation doth but hide, not deſtroy their union,) and they muſt appear to be one again. Indeed he is a God to them at preſent, he taketh care of them at preſent, his eye is continually upon them, and his heart with them in all their bondage and captivities; but he is not ſo a God to them as he will be when he brings them forth as his people under this Covenant. And well may he forbear appearing thus a God to them, for he doth not yet ſo appear a God to himſelf, but his own Name, Glory and Excellencies go to wrack and ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And they ſhall be to me a people.</hi> Not only Gods people, (ſo they are where ever they are, and in what ſtate and condition ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,) but a people to him, a people that walks every way like his people, <hi>children that will not lye</hi> and deceive in that relation which they pretend to ſtand and act in.</p>
            <p>There are two things which a people ſtand indebted to God in, <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> in neither of which ſhall they fall ſhort.</p>
            <p>God loves his people entirely, and he cannot be ſatisfied unleſs they love him again: ye know, it goes to our hearts to have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of love from them on whom we beſtow all our affection. It is Gods great deſire, to have a people that may love him, that may receive and anſwer all his Love: When he choſe the Jews, this was the main thing he looked for from them, <hi>viz.</hi> Love in that way wherein he loved them, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.</hi> As it is Gods Love makes him chuſe a people, ſo it is their love he doth it for, that the ſame Love may have free ſcope between them. The end of this Covenant being to engage hearts together, Love is a neceſſary fruit on both ſides. It is the root, the main ingredient and the fruit on both ſides. That from or out of which the Covenant grows is Love, that which makes up the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is Love, that which ſprouts out of the Covenant is Love. Becauſe God loves his people, therefore he makes this Covenant with them, that which he makes this Covenant up of is his own Love, and as it contains his Love, ſo it is continually emptying it into them: and they fall in with this Covenant from the ſame Love, that they might have the ſame way, and the ſame advantage of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:165768:41"/>
emptying their Love into him. And Obedience is neceſſary to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the truth of Love: <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments: Thou ſhalt love the Lord, and keep all his Statutes,</hi> he preſcribes the Law of Obedience immediately after the Command of loving him. As God muſt perfectly write his Law in their hearts, or he cannot fully teſtifie his Love: So they muſt perfectly obey every tittle, or they cannot fully teſtifie their love. Now the people of God ſhall fail neither in Love nor Obedience to him when he comes to ſet up this Covenant among them; but they ſhall love him as much as he deſires to be loved, and obey him as much as he deſires to be obeyed; <hi>they ſhall be to him a people,</hi> he ſhall have every thing fully from them that he can expect from a people.</p>
            <p>And ſo by this means, by this Covenant will he amend both thoſe faults which he excepted againſt in the former Covenant, verſ. 9. God diſliked that Covenant, but why? There are two Reaſons rendered in that 9. verſ. The one was, becauſe <hi>they continued not in it;</hi> The other was, becauſe God was <hi>not ſufficiently engaged by it</hi> to reſpect them. Neither God nor they were bound cloſe enough to one another in that Covenant, the bonds were not ſtrait enough for either, but they were able to ſtart from God notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Covenant; and God was left at liberty too, he could ſlip looſe from them for all this Covenant: Notwithſtanding the bond of this Covenant, he regarded them not, he did not look upon them as his people, and ſo on himſelf as their God, to take care of them as of his people, but let enemies looſe upon them, ſcattered them up and down, become of them what would he cared not, <hi>I regarded them not, ſaith the Lord.</hi> But now in this Covenant God undertakes, and hath ſo framed it, that he will be ſure to mend both thoſe faults; it ſhall ſo bind him and his people together, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall be able to ſtart one hairs bredth from the other, but when they once meet they ſhall ever remain together in perfect Life and Love; <hi>He will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to him a people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And they ſhall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord: for all ſhall know me, from the least to the greateſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The happineſs, the perfection of the creature conſiſts in the knowledg of God. A man might be any thing, do any thing, have
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:165768:42"/>
any thing, enjoy any thing, if he knew but God: If he had but the Light of God, he could not but have the Life of God alſo, for the Life lies in it; <hi>This is life Eternal, to know thee the only true God.</hi> If a man were <hi>in the light, as he is in the light,</hi> he could not but walk in the light with him. This is the great miſery of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God is ſhut up from it, and it is ſhut out from God; and there is nothing but emptineſs, vanity and miſery to be met with, while God remains unknown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mans excellency lieth in knowledg.</hi> Wherein doth man excel the other creatures, but in his knowledg? The light of this world the creatures have in common with him, but not the light of his mind. Wherein doth one man excel another, but in knowledg? He that knows much in any kind, excels others in that kind who fall ſhort of him in that knowledg. He that knows moſt (moſt certainly, moſt clearly, moſt fully) in the deepeſt kind of knowledg, excels all others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The proper object of knowledg is God;</hi> there is nothing elſe worth knowing; the knowledg of any thing elſe begets and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes miſery. And there is but one kind of knowledg of God neither that tends towards happineſs, and that is that knowledg of himſelf which he giveth out to his people in his own Light: all other knowledg is death, and carries deſtruction in the bowels of it. The knowledg of God as it ſprings up in the creature deſtroys the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that life it ſeems to feed and nouriſh it doth but fatten for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and ſo moveth towards deſtruction even therein; that knowledg alone preſerves the creature, which comes immediately from God into the creature, and carries the creature out of it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, where it lodges and lives ſave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The knowledg of God</hi> (ſince the broken, dark ſtate of man) <hi>comes by teaching,</hi> by ſuch a Miniſtry and Miniſtration as God pleaſes to ſet up among his people, who are the perſons he alone picks out to know, and to make himſelf known unto. The Law was given to the Jews by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and he and <hi>Aaron</hi> (the Prieſts and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets) were ſtill to open the Law unto them, and to teach them to know God by it; <hi>The Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledg, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth.</hi> Men were alſo to teach one another according to the light they had, according to the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they ſtood in, according to the conveniencies and opportunities
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:165768:42"/>
that were cut out unto them for the inſtruction and exhortation of one another: Thus <hi>every man was to teach his neighbor, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord; This is your life, this is your happineſs, this is that ye were choſen by him for, to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be acquainted with him, to underſtand his mind, therefore what ever ye do look to it, make it your main buſineſs to know the Lord.</hi> So in the times of the Apoſtles there was the ſame way of teaching, we ſhall find men there likewiſe communicating the knowledg of God to one another, and preſſing them earneſtly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and retain this knowledg, (there was a tang of ſomewhat fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but it was neither univerſal, full, nor laſting.)</p>
            <p>But now when this Covenant comes to be ſet up there ſhall need no more of this teaching, this teaching ſhall continue no longer: God will ſo himſelf diffuſe the knowledg of himſelf into every one, according to what they need, and can hold, that none ſhall need to look abroad for it. Every one ſhall drink water out of their own Ciſtern, or rather out of their own Fountain, <hi>for all ſhall know me.</hi> There ſhall not remain one, among the whole people of God, ignorant of God; there ſhall not any one need any other teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or be taught any other ways then as <hi>the anointing</hi> teacheth him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From the least to the greateſt.</hi> God produceth every thing in great variety. There are ſmaller and greater in every ſort of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Though they are much one, yet they differ much alſo. They differ in their ſhape, in their dimenſion, in beauty, vertue, ſtrength and ſpirit; ſome are of mean low ſpirits, others of high, noble, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſpirits. So is it in his Seed. In the natural ſeed, the Jews, there was a difference, both in the Tribes, and in the Families, and in the particular perſons in each Tribe and Family: And as there were many other differences, ſo there was particularly this in reſpect of <hi>the knowledg of God,</hi> ſome having much knowledg of the Law, others little, ſome none at all. So in the ſpiritual Seed, there are <hi>little ones</hi> (babes in Chriſt) <hi>young men, old men,</hi> experienced men, <hi>ſtrong men,</hi> men ſtrong in Faith, in Love, in the Life and Power of God, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But this was the common way of all their learning, <hi>viz.</hi> by teaching one another. Indeed the Apoſtles were not taught by men, but immediately by God, but that was not uſual, it was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:165768:43"/>
to their particular work, but the Churches were taught by one another, by the Officers, and by the Brethren in them: So that this hath been the common way hitherto. But, when this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is ſet up in full force, every one ſhall be taught by the Lord, <hi>all thy children ſhall be taught of God,</hi> and ſo taught, that every one ſhall know God. Man can but lay, what he teacheth, before the underſtanding; but God can infuſe it into the heart, he can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently leaven the heart with it; when he teacheth there is none ſhall avoyd learning, but they ſhall all know the Lord, <hi>from the leaſt to the greateſt:</hi> They ſhall all learn of him, and they ſhall all learn him, from the very leaſt to the greateſt. The hardeſt leſſon that is (for there is nothing harder then to know God) God will teach his meaneſt ſchollar. God will not have any blockhead or dullard in his School, but the leaſt there ſhall be able to comprehend <hi>himſelf. From the least to the greatest:</hi> He that is leaſt, he that hath leaſt, yet he ſhall not receive it from others, but from God: He that hath leaſt light, leaſt life, ſhall have that he has pure from the Fountain. The leaſt of his he will teach, and the very leaſt thing that is to be taught them, he himſelf will teach them. He will ſuffer none to teach his but himſelf; indeed the leaſt thing that can be known cannot thus be taught by any but himſelf. And he that is greateſt, fulleſt, who had need have much to fill him, yet ſhall not draw one jot of it from any Ciſtern, but all from <hi>the living God.</hi> The greateſt in the Life, Liberty and Power of God, he will teach yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the leaſt he will teach ſufficiently; he will teach every one from the very beginning to the end of all his School; and he will teach every one effectually, ſo as they ſhall need no other Teacher, ſo as they ſhall need no otherwiſe to be taught, ſo as they ſhall not chuſe but learn that leſſon every one of them, wherein lieth their whole life and happineſs, <hi>they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> God will make his people vomit up all the knowledg of himſelf that ever they have received, he will break the old bottles, and ſpill all the wine they held, and this will he do from the leaſt to the greateſt: The higheſt in the knowledg of God, who have the pureſt, the cleareſt light, ſhall not be able to preſerve one ſcrap of their knowledg from deſtruction. And then will he make <hi>new bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi> and fill them with <hi>new wine:</hi> Every bottle muſt be new-made that is filled with this wine, and every bottle that is new-made ſhall

            <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>For I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the ground of all, here is the firſt beginning of all, here is the eſtabliſhment of all this good will, love and ſweetneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his people: He will certainly do it, for he will take away that which hinders, that which any way ſtops or diverts the current of their affection and intimacy on either hand. That which had the great force in the other Covenant to eſtrange God and his people, was ſin; <hi>Your iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God, and your ſins have hid his face from you:</hi> Sin made God turn from them, and ſin made them turn from God; for, feeling the guilt of ſin in his own ſpirit, man runs as far and as faſt from him as he can. <hi>Adam</hi> had great delight in the preſence of God, and <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Adams</hi> till he had ſinned, then the appearance of God is terrible to him, and he ſeeketh to hide himſelf from his preſence: and ſince that time guilty man could never endure to come neer God. To quiet himſelf he is fain to frame a God ſuitable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and this he can come neer and delight himſelf with; but <hi>the true, the living God,</hi> who can pierce into him and will not be bribed to ſpare him, the heart of man cannot endure to come neer: Every man is apt to think that of all things he deſires God, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, but the appearance of God will one day give him the lye. And this ariſeth from the ſecret guilt of ſin, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be dawbed up at preſent, yet the purity of Gods preſence cannot but ſearch and diſcern it: The ſight of ſin is drowned and loſt at preſent, every man almoſt hath an art to hide, ſilence, cover and bury ſin; but the approach of God will put life into it again, the effects whereof will be ſuch as will make his coming very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcom even to ſuch as now ſeem to themſelves much to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Majeſty and Terror of God, whom would it not affright!</hi> how can ſinful fleſh ſtand before him! There is no hiding any ſin from him, for the light in him diſcovers it: There is no undergoing his wrath, it is too weighty for any creature. While any ſin remains upon the conſcience of the creature, it cannot but ſtartle at God and ſhrink from him; while any ſin remains upon the ſcore of the creature God cannot but be dreadful to it: O what a diſtance and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:165768:44"/>
ſhyneſs is there between him and his deareſt ones while any reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remains between them!</p>
            <p>O how little true intercourſe and communion is there between God and any man at this day! There is a great deal of ſeeming boldneſs in drawing nigh to him and claiming acquaintance with him, ariſing from ignorance and from an imagination of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin; but alaſs how will this vaniſh, when he comes to make himſelf known and to lay mens ſins to their charge, which are not yet ſo blotted out as they think they are. I will do it, ſaith he, at ſuch a time, but the time is not yet come: <hi>The blotting out of ſin is reſerved for the times of refreſhing,</hi> for the days wherein this Covenant ſhall be ſet up; Then God will indeed do great things for his people, and nothing ſhall fall ſhort of all that ſweetneſs and perfect communion that he hath ſpoken of between him and them, for all that might interpoſe ſhall be taken away by him; <hi>for I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities will I remember no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs</hi> holds forth the nature of ſin in general, for ſin is nothing but <hi>unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Take what ſin you will into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, this is the nature of it, this is the chief property of it, this is that which makes it to be ſin, which brings the perſon into danger from whom it flows, which any way divers God from or incites God againſt the creature, namely its unrighteouſneſs. The influence which ſin hath upon the Juſtice of God (which is an utter enemy to it) is by its unrighteouſneſs: The harm it doth to the creature, both by deforming it, defiling it, and laying it open to wrath and miſery, is by its unrighteouſneſs: That which maketh it to be ſin, that whereby it produceth all its effects, is its unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Their unrighteouſneſs.</hi> The People of God, who are dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, whom his heart is upon, whom he intends to do all the good he can to, whom he means to bring into perfect union and communion with himſelf, yet have their unrighteouſneſs belonging to them, cleaving to them, they are not yet freed from ſin, but lie with the reſt of the world overwhelmed and buryed under the heap and rubbiſh of it. Indeed there is that life and hope in them that will one day ſpring out of the grave and throw off all the fetters
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:165768:44"/>
and boods of ſin, but at preſent there is little difference between them and others, ſaving that they are ſomewhat more ſenſible of their burthen, which makes their yoke ſmart the more: Sin clings yet to their conſciences, they are yet ſlaves under it, they are yet in captivity and miſery becauſe of it. If mercy had took its ſwinge upon them, ſin could not ſo remain and dwell in them, nor the effects of ſin ſo follow them as they continually do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs.</hi> As Juſtice hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto had and muſt ſtill have its ſcope to proſecute ſin, to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere againſt ſin where ever it findes it: So then mercy ſhall have its ſcope, and ſhall be able to anſwer juſtice in all its pleas againſt the ſinner; and the poor creature (that is now worn out by the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting <hi>avenger of blood</hi>) ſhall be refreſhed, ſhall never hear more concerning ſin but what mercy ſpeaks. And mercy ſhall have full vent, God will ſet himſelf to be merciful. When Juſtice hath had its full time, its full hearing; then Mercy ſhall have its turn, and be fairly heard to what it can ſay for the reſcue and Salvation of the ſinner. God will give himſelf up to mercy, ſet himſelf to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, <hi>I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs;</hi> Where ever I eſpy unrighteouſneſs in them I will ſhew forth mercy; I will hear no voyce of ſin but what calls for mercy; There's not one of their ſins ſhall ſtand before me, if I have mercy enough to blot it out; If ever ſin prejudice them any more, let the blame lie upon my mercy; <hi>I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And their ſins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</hi> There are two ſorts of ſin (two ways of ſinning) one of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion the other of omiſſion. There is a direct ſpurning againſt the Law, and a falling ſhort of the Law. There is a doing things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Will of God, and a neglecting to do the Will of God: There is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as they are here expreſſed. This is the great charge God hath againſt all men, under all his ſeveral Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the not doing what he in righteouſnes requires of them, and the doing otherwiſe or contrary thereunto; the ſlipping aſide from his Rule, or the claſhing againſt his Rule by motions contrary to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will remember no more.</hi> They ſhall be ſo far from feeling any prejudice by reaſon of ſin any more, that I will not ſo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that they have ſinned. Not any Tranſgreſſion againſt the Law, not any falling ſhort of the Law will I ever remember again;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:165768:45"/>
I will think never the worſe of them for it, I will carry my ſelf not one whit the more unkindly to them becauſe of it, there ſhall be no ſtrangeneſs between me and them in any ſuch reſpect. I will not onely pity them and be merciful to them, but my mercy ſhall carry me to do the utmoſt act againſt ſin, that can be done, to keep it from prejudicing them: I will not onely pity them in their ſins and under their miſeries ſhewing mercy to them in reſpect of both, but I will heal them perfectly, I will cure them for ever, I will take away the root of their ſickneſs and all the ſap that can feed that root. I will not onely forgive ſin, but I will forget it too: I will blot it out of mine own minde that it may never be by me to ſtir up the leaſt jealouſie or harſh thoughts in me concerning them. Their ſins ſhall be ſo far from ever working upon my heart that I will not keep them in my minde; I will not think of them again, I will ſet my ſelf to forget them, I will not ſuffer the remembrance of them to enter into me or come any more before me: I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver henceforth look upon them as perſons that ever did any ſuch thing, but what they have offended in I will ſo diſcharge them of that the offence ſhall for ever be forgotten even by my ſelf. <hi>I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities will I remember no more.</hi>

            <p>O ſweet Covenant! O certain way of emptying God into his people, and of letting in his people into his fulneſs! Surely they can never miſs of any thing they deſire who lie under the direct influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this Covenant.</p>
            <p>But when ſhall theſe things be! when ſhall this Covenant be ſet up! There was a ſweet taſte of it, once given out, in the Primitive Times, (The Spirit was then given out, there was then enjoying of God, living in and towards God, rejoycing in tribulation, triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over ſin, Law, Death, Hell, &amp;c. the yoke of the Croſs was then eaſie, ſweet, delightful, &amp;c.) but it was but a taſte, but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the thing it ſelf: it was weak while it was in Being, it was quickly ſwallowed up: The ſweetneſs of the intercourſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between God and his people was low and liable to frequent interruptions in the midſt of its enjoyment: Sin was not conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (though ſorely ſtrook at and wounded) but in conflict, and after a while gathered up its ſtrength and overcame that appearance of God in the world. Since which time there hath been much quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:165768:45"/>
much reſt, much peace in the world, in the Kingdom of the Devil, all being at his diſpoſe, he reigning and commanding in open wickedneſs, in moral righteouſneſs, in the ſeveral ways and paths of Religion; and the holy ſeed being in ſuch bondage and captivity under him, ſo ſhut up in his dark priſon that they ſee not where they are, nor what they are, nor have either heart or ſtrength to oppoſe him: Things being thus, the Devil lieth ſtill, Sin is quiet, the Law is ſilent, they are where they would be, they have what they would, they do what they would; God and Chriſt overlook this time of ignorance, take as it were no notice what the Devil does, do not ſo much as offer to diſturb him. But when God ſhall once ſtir <hi>to ſet up his Kingdom,</hi> when Chriſt ariſeth <hi>to recover his own</hi> out of the Devils hands, then it will be a quick ſharp time, then <hi>Satan Sin and the Law</hi> will put forth their ſtrength, and will <hi>not let Iſrael go</hi> while they have any power to detain them; and O how dreadful will the breaking of their power be, and how fierce their tyranny over <hi>Iſrael</hi> while it is in breaking! Then ſhal <hi>Iſrael</hi> feel the bitterneſs of bondage and of captivity; then ſhall <hi>Iſrael</hi> know what Sin is, what the Law is, and what the Devil is. O how terrible will their death-pangs be! O how will they rent and teer at their caſting out! when they fall (<hi>Sampſon</hi>-like) they will make the very houſe fall with them: And indeed the leproſie of Sin hath ſo overſpred and is ſo interwoven that there is no purging of it out without breaking the veſſel all in peeces and melting thoſe broken peeces over and over again and again; Corruption will never be purged out of this old man, but this old man muſt be deſtroyed and a new one made. God alſo will be very ſharp, very ſevere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all manner of ſin and unrighteouſneſs according to the Law, while the Law remains in force to exact it from him: yea Chriſt himſelf will be a ſore Miniſter of Juſtice, (until his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs come to conquer and take place) <hi>He will not pardon your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, for my name is in him.</hi> Alaſs, what a dream are we in! We have a kinde of ſenſe of ſin, and a kinde of ſight of Chriſt and Salvation, and a kinde of going forth (by that which we call Faith) for Salvation from him, and thus we think to paſs over unto reſt: No, no, we muſt feel our captivity, we muſt come under and feel the force of the Miniſtration of Condemnation, we muſt taſte the death-pangs of Sin and the Law, and we muſt fetch every ſtep of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:165768:46"/>
our journey or travel through the wilderneſs to the promiſed Land, as in the type there was not one of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God exempted from ſo doing. And when this is in agitation, then ye ſhall know the meaning of ſo many <hi>carkaſſes of the Iſraelites falling in the wilderneſs,</hi> and how thoſe <hi>to whom a promiſe is made of entering into Reſt, may fall ſhort by unbelief;</hi> and then ye ſhall finde <hi>the whole mystery of Salvation</hi> (both in the type and in the ſubſtance) to be another-gheſs manner of thing then man (by his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reaſon, or by that which he calls the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God) hath interpreted it to be.</p>

               <hi>Haſten thy work O God; Let thy counſel ſtand: Fulfil all thy pleaſure;</hi> and do it as ſpeedily as thou wilt. Let forth that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that deſolation which muſt neceſſarily precede and make way for Salvation: Let the old Covenant devour and bury in her own bowels the fruit of her own womb, that the new ſeed may be conceived, formed, quickened, brought forth, and hang upon the breſts of the new Covenant, whence nothing but <hi>the ſweetneſs, purity and power of Life</hi> can be ſucked. <hi>Live O God,</hi> live in thy ſeed; quicken thy ſeed, let them (cauſe them) to live in thee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law and by the vertue of thine own life. Finiſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, weakneſs, ſin, vanity, death; daſh it out, and write thine own perfection and life in the ſtead and room of it: Blot out the name of the fooliſh, vain, empty creature, and write thine own name every where; then ſhall thoſe that deſire and love thee be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with thee, when they ſhall meet none but thee, and meet thee every where.</p>

            <p>IN theſe words there are divers remarkable paſſages, which he is very likely to meet with, who purſueth the purity and height of the life of his ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is the excellency of a Chriſtians life, the top of it; which lieth in Viſions and Revelations, in Gods opening of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and ſpiritual things to the eye of his ſpirit, letting him in to the other world to behold God, himſelf, and the ſtate of things there: <hi>Ye are come to mount Sion, to the City of the living God the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:165768:47"/>
Jeruſalem, and to an innumerable company of Angels, to the general Aſſembly and Church of the firſt born, to God the Judg of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, &amp;c.</hi> Here is life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, here is true ſight, true enjoyment; here is the poſſeſſion of ſtrength; he feels nothing, fears nothing that may affright or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him, who is here, being wrapt up ſafe in the boſom of Eternity, where mortality cannot ſeize upon him: And the greater, the fuller, the deeper, the more frequent and abundant theſe Viſions are, the quicker and ſtronger is the life by them, the more is the ſpirit eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The danger of this life, the danger of theſe enjoyments; they tend to over-exalt him, his fleſh cannot bear them, he is puffed up by them and forgets himſelf becauſe of them: <hi>Leſt I ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above meaſure through the abundance of revelations: Paul</hi> was in great danger of being lift up beyond all bounds by reaſon of theſe; his ſtrength, though it was great and much more then ordinary, yet it was no way proportionable to his Revelations. God can bear the weight of all his glory, he is not at all lifted up with the ſight and poſſeſſion of his own ſtrength and fulneſs: but fleſh cannot do ſo, it is lifted up with any thing, with every thing that is a little more then ordinary, a little above it ſelf; and if its life and enjoyments be over-vigorous (be much more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) they over-exalt it. This is the fooliſhneſs of the creature, it deſires the higheſt life, the beſt, the pureſt, the ſtrongeſt food; but is not able to bear any thing beyond it ſelf, nothing but what is ſuitable to its proportion of life: and it onely enjoyeth it ſelf while, <hi>by eternal Wiſdom and Power,</hi> it is guided and kept within its own bounds: The Plants cannot live the life of Senſitives, Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives cannot live the life of Man, Man cannot live the life of God; he cannot know as he knows, he cannot comprehend as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends, he cannot live as he lives: We think, if we had abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſights and enjoyments of God, we ſhould live abundantly; Alaſs, poor fools! Behold the experiment, it almoſt overturned <hi>Paul,</hi> lifted up his fleſh ſo high that it coſt him very dear to have it brought down again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exaltation</hi> is the worſt poſture of ſpirit, (of the worſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the moſt prejudicial to the Creature) that can be. It is the moſt unbeſeeming poſture, the moſt diſhonorable to God, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:165768:47"/>
that which ſets the Creature at the greateſt diſtance from him.</p>
            <p>It is the moſt unbeſeeming poſture: for what is the Creature? <hi>Nothing, emptineſs, vanity, a lye,</hi> that which <hi>appears,</hi> but <hi>is not;</hi> a puff of wind that maketh a noiſe, but <hi>paſſeth away, and cometh not again.</hi> Now for this to be lifted up, as if it were ſomewhat, as if it were ſubſtance, nay as if it were all, as if it knew all, as if <hi>it alone were, and none beſides it,</hi> what more uncomely thing? And yet ſuch is the fooliſhneſs of the creature, that let God but open himſelf a little to it, it preſently conceits it ſelf to be as himſelf; let him but open himſelf in it, it in himſelf, and it preſently is God as truly, as fully as himſelf; let him but open a little of his boſom, a little beyond what it hath formerly ſeen, and it preſently ſees as himſelf, and ſo certainly that things cannot poſſibly be otherwiſe then as it now ſees. O uncomely Spectacle! O how my Soul loaths the creature lifted up! O how ſordid is the creature aſpiring to, aſſuming and clothing himſelf with that greatneſs, ſtate and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, which belongs not to him, and which he can in no wiſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age! O God, thou muſt needs deſtroy, and prepare a grave to bury this uncomelineſs in.</p>
            <p>It is the moſt diſhonourable to God, intrenching moſt upon his Glory who is all, who fills all, who can endure nothing to be or appear where he is in his own Life and Fulneſs. The creature ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lifts up it ſelf, but it throws down God (as much as in it lies,) it robs him, and prides it ſelf with what it hath ſtollen, as if it were its own; it defloureth his Beauties, his Excellencies, by making them appear unlike his, and as if they were not his; it raſeth his Name out of that wherein he hath written in, writing its own in ſtead thereof.</p>
            <p>It ſets the creature at the greateſt diſtance from God; it turns the heart of God moſt from the creature. God can only have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the creature in its low eſtate; it muſt be nothing, when he (who is all) fills it, and dwells fully in it. So much as the creature ſtrives to be, deſires to be, it turns from God. God is all, where he is himſelf; and appears as all, where he appears as himſelf; and he cannot fully be, not fully appear in that creature that is, or that appears any thing. <hi>The proud he beholds afar off,</hi> but <hi>he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his habitation with the humble;</hi> he lives there, he dwells
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:165768:48"/>
there: and the humble may walk, converſe, have full and free com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him; <hi>humble thy ſelf to walk with thy God.</hi> It were better for the creature never to ſee or enjoy any thing of God, then to be lifted up by it: and, if I might have mine own choyce, I would never have any diſcovery of God, further then I were firſt enabled by him to bear it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Remedy of this danger, which hath a very proper appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation here, it is called <hi>a thorn to the fleſh,</hi> ſomewhat to prick and make the fleſh ſenſible of its weakneſs, and ſo to abate and aſſwage its ſwelling. <hi>Fleſh</hi> is the weak part, <hi>a thorn</hi> is that which is very painful and irkſom to the fleſh. Viſions and Revelations, they lift up the fleſh, cauſe it to forget it ſelf, raiſe it up in its own eyes and thoughts, as if it were <hi>no longer fleſh but ſpirit, no longer weakneſs but ſtrength,</hi> ſurrounded with the <hi>Life, Glory and Perfection of God,</hi> which theſe give ſome taſte and ſenſe of; ſo that the poor creature begins now to perk up above all other things, beholding them far beneath it ſelf, they lying in <hi>a dungeon of darkneſs, horror, weakneſs, filthineſs, corruption, death,</hi> whereas it is ſcituated <hi>in the light of the Lord,</hi> dwelling with him <hi>in the Land of the living:</hi> But now, when a thorn is thruſt into the fleſh, making it ake and ſmart, (and all its Viſions and Revelations can neither help to pluck out this thorn, nor take away the ſmart of it,) it begins to feel and know it ſelf again, it finds it ſelf not to be what it took it ſelf to be, not to be where it was, not ſo full, not ſo glorious, not ſo ſafe: It thought it ſelf above all theſe things, above the reach, above the ſenſe of theſe things; but now by this it ſenſibly perceives, that it is ſtill a weak frail creature in a weak frail ſtate: This lets the wind out of the bladder, and ſo its ſwelling falls by degrees. There is no better phyſick in ſuch a ſtate, and it is the skill and kindneſs of the Phyſician, to adminiſter it to the Patient, though againſt his mind: <hi>Paul</hi> here calls it a gift, <hi>there was given me a thorn to the fleſh;</hi> indeed it was a gift, a kind gift, a needful gift, a ſeaſonable g ft. <hi>Paul,</hi> if he might have had his own choyce, would have had more <hi>Revelations</hi> ſtill: but he, who knew the preſent ſtate of <hi>Paul,</hi> knew what to give him; and however he looked upon it at preſent, yet afterwards (when he came to underſtand himſelf) he could not but ſee and acknowledg it to be a gift. The <hi>captivity</hi> of our life, that <hi>pain, bondage, heavineſs of ſpirit, death</hi> (which we
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:165768:48"/>
are ſo apt to complain of) is <hi>a gift,</hi> which our life, in this ſtate wherein it is, needs, (<hi>if need be ye ſuffer heavineſs through mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold temptations,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6.) it cannot otherwiſe enjoy it ſelf, it cannot otherwiſe be rid of that enemy which is ſtill ſurprizing it in its enjoyments.</p>
            <p>The particular <hi>thorn to the fleſh</hi> here beſtowed on <hi>Paul,</hi> was <hi>a meſſenger of Satan to buffet him.</hi> To bring him down Satan is let looſe upon him, (who, when he hath his Commiſſion, will quickly make the fleſh feel it ſelf what it is:) To bring him down yet more Satan deals with him by a meſſenger, as if (notwithſtanding all his height) he ſcorned to deal with him himſelf; and this meſſenger handles him in a moſt diſgraceful way, <hi>buffets him;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> lieth open to him, not knowing which way to help himſelf, but is fain to receive blow after blow from him, as he gives them him: This was <hi>a thorn to the fleſh</hi> indeed, a very ſharp thorn.</p>
            <p>He who knoweth what it is, to be wrapt up into the might and power of the Lord, cannot at that time fear the powers of darkneſs, dares challenge the very <hi>Prince of darkneſs,</hi> with all his force and ſtratagems, to do his worſt, and cannot ſuſpect the leaſt prejudice from him. Now for this perſon, who knoweth the ſweetneſs of this ſtrength, to be wholly ſtripped of it, have his enemy let looſe upon him, be left to the weakneſs of his own fleſh, be laid open to receive and feel the ſmart of every blow that Satan pleaſeth to give him, and that not by himſelf, but by <hi>a meſſenger,</hi> (as if he ſcorned to put his own ſtrength to it,) this is a grievous thorn to the fleſh, this pricketh very ſharply the weak, the fleſhly part, and by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance allayeth and letteth out that ſwelling and puffing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was lifted up by thoſe Revelations and Inlets of the Life, Glory and Power of God, which were beſtowed not on it, but on the ſpiritual part. It is the fleſh that is lifted up; and were it not for the fleſhly part, the ſpirit would as willingly lie low as be exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea in ſome reſpect rather, for it deſireth not to be exalted, but to lie low; it deſireth to have <hi>the Lord alone exalted;</hi> it would not be any thing, it would not appear any thing, it would not own any thing, but have the Lord alone be, appear, be known; So far would it live as the Lord liveth in it, ſo far would it ſhine as the Lord pleaſeth to ſhine in it, and no further: And the ſufferings of the ſpirit are with and becauſe of the fleſh, and to this intent, to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:165768:49"/>
free and deliver it from the infirmity, bondage and corruption which cleaveth cloſe to the fleſh, and is ready ſtill to annoy it by reaſon of its preſent conjunction with the fleſh.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit and the fleſh are ſo incorporated one within the other (yet unmixed) that whatſoever is done to the one, the other alſo partakes of, (as ſuppoſe, like two trees, whoſe root, body, boughs, branches, leaves and fruit were entwiſted within one another, yet ſtill retaining their own property and diſtinction.) You cannot feed the ſpirit, but the fleſh alſo will ſuck in and partake of the ſweetneſs thereof, and be nouriſhed and grow thereby: you cannot feed the fleſh, but the ſpirit taſts and is made ſick by the poyſon; for ſuch is the food of the fleſh unto the ſpirit, no other then poyſon. You cannot ſmite the fleſh, but you alſo wound the ſpirit; and if you go about to heal the ſpirit, the fleſh will alſo partake of it, and gather ſtrength and freſhneſs by it: If the fleſh be thrown into the furnace, the ſpirit goes with it, and is burnt and melted in the fire as well as it. Therefore all the life the ſpirit gains, poſſeſſes, pleaſes it ſelf with, it muſt part with again, and muſt dye a bitter death with the fleſh, that it may be quite rid of the fleſh: all its life muſt ſink back into its principle, and lie there as if it were dead, while the fleſh is truly mortified and ſlain for ever: And if it were not of an excellent nature, if it could not bear the force of that fire which kills and burns up the fleſh, it would alſo be ſlain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with the fleſh; if it were not pure gold, it could not but waſte and periſh in the heat of that furnace, which is ſtill conſuming, and at laſt (when it is heated hot enough) will quite devour all fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly droſs whatſoever, that is caſt into it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The reſtleſneſs of the ſpirit under this Remedy: <hi>For this thing I be ſought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me:</hi> He uſeth the beſt means with the utmoſt vigour to get rid of it. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more effectual then prayer, then fervent prayer, then conſtant prayer. We have no ſtrength of our own, our ſtrength lies in God; faith and prayer (or faith in prayer) is our readieſt and ſureſt way of recourſe to him for it. <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth once, yea again, and again, and fain he would be heard: and mark the earneſtneſs of his ſpirit, <hi>that it might depart from me.</hi> He doth not pray for ſtrength to bear it, for ſubmiſſion to the Will of God, for ſpiritual benefit and advantage by it; No, nothing will ſerve his turn but to have it taken
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:165768:49"/>
away, to have it removed, to have it <hi>depart;</hi> the pain, the ſhame is ſo great, that he can by no means be content to lie under it. This is ſuch phyſick as we would never take, if we might chuſe; it maketh us ſo ſick, that we would rather be without health then come by it this way: If this remedy were not forced upon us, this ſickneſs would always remain with us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſupport of the Soul under this reſtleſſneſs, the Cordial that is of moſt force to refreſh the ſpirits, under the violent work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this phyſick, which make the ſpirits very faint, and bring the Soul very low; <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> The Grace of God, the good will of God revealed to, taſted by the Soul, is able to refreſh and ſupport it under ſenſe of the greateſt miſery. There are two things of very great efficacy in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a taſte of ſweetneſs at preſent, which doth ſecretly relieve, refreſh, revive the ſpirit. He who ever knew God, let him at any time taſte the favour and love of God, though in the loweſt, darkeſt, deadeſt, moſt oppreſſed ſtate he can be in, he cannot but find a ſecret touch of life in it, <hi>in thy favour is life,</hi> yea <hi>thy loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is better then life;</hi> it is better to taſte the ſweetneſs, the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the love of God in the moſt bitter pangs of death, then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſweeteſt touches and motions of life in ones own ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is an aſſurance of a good iſſue, and of all this tending that way. He who ſees the Grace of God (the vertue of its nature, its skill and efficacy in operation) will ſee his phyſick adminiſtred to him from that Grace, and working by that Grace. He ſees no more the temptations of the Devil in the Devils hand, or his own ſins in his own hand, doing him miſchief; but in Gods hand doing him good: He ſees his own weakneſs, not any longer his ſnare, but his advantage, making way to rid him of his weakneſs, and to give him full poſſeſſion of the ſtrength of God, <hi>for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> The ſtrength of God is not made perfect in the diſcovery of it ſelf to the creature, in the creature, for the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, till the creature be made perfectly weak. While there is any ſtrength left in the creature, there is ſome room left there which the ſtrength of God doth not fill: the ſtrength of God may be there, but not all his ſtrength; the ſtrength of God may act there, but not perfectly. The ſtrength of God can never do, that it hath to do for the Soul to perfect it, before the Soul be firſt made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:165768:50"/>
weak; and then the ſtrength of God will ſoon be perfected, when the Soul is brought to perfect weakneſs. When we are brought into <hi>perfect captivity, and perfectly weakened in captivity,</hi> ſo that <hi>there is nothing left, nothing remaining, nothing viſible to be delivered, but the whole life of the ſpirit is perfectly dryed up and lost even for ever,</hi> then is there nothing to hinder the breaking forth of <hi>perfect deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The exultation of the ſpirit, from the ſenſe and experience of the good that the Grace of God works for it by theſe: it can here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſport with miſery, play with death, laugh while it is in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry jaws of deſtruction; <hi>Moſt gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities.</hi> I will not be ſo aſhamed of my weakneſs now I know what it is, and whither it tends, but I will <hi>glory</hi> in it; I will rejoyce in mine own inability to withſtand temptations, to keep back the breaking forth of any corruption in me, to ſecure my ſelf from the meaneſt meſſenger of Satan; and I will not do it as a forced thing, but <hi>moſt gladly;</hi> it ſhall be a free motion of my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that which it ſhall moſt freely give it ſelf up to, namely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in and becauſe of its weakneſs, <hi>moſt gladly therefore, &amp;c.</hi> Yea I will <hi>rather</hi> do it; I will chuſe to rejoyce and glory in them before I would do it in Revelations: I like them better, they tend to bring me nearer to that which my ſpirit longs after, whereas Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations tend to ſet me further from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Power of Christ may reſt upon me.</hi> My life, my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs lies in enjoying the Power of Chriſt, Revelations tend to ſtrip me of it, but weakneſſes tend to poſſeſs me of it, yea to cauſe it to <hi>reſt upon me,</hi> not only to ſeize upon me, but to abide with me: Our weakneſſes are not only to fit us for ſome more vigorous aid and aſſiſtance from God, but for the inhabitation of God, there will he dwell, thither ſhall the Power of Chriſt reſort, and there ſhall it reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore I take pleaſure in infirmities.</hi> I will never be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be weakened again: Since I knew the meaning of it, I cannot but take pleaſure in it. It is my delight to be made weak, to be thrown down, to be reproached, to be bemired in my own filth, (I could not endure ſhame immediately after my Revelations, but now I can pleaſe my ſelf to behold mine own ſhame.) Yea I love to be brought to <hi>neceſſities,</hi> to <hi>distreſſes,</hi> that I know not
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:165768:50"/>
which way to turn my ſelf: for all this is for <hi>Chriſts ſake,</hi> to give him more hold of me, to give him more advantage to work himſelf into me; this weakening of me, by all theſe ſharp corraſives to the fleſh, is but the pulling down of my ſtrength that he may ſet up his, and I ſenſibly feel it in conſtant experience; <hi>for when I am weak then am I ſtrong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am never ſtrong but when I am weak, nor never weak but when I am ſtrong. A ſtrange Paradox, that a mans ſtrength ſhould lie in his weakneſs, that the time of his weakneſs ſhould be the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his ſtrength, that the way to make him ſtrong ſhould be by making him weak: yet <hi>Paul</hi> felt, and therefore ye may give him leave to ſpeak; he ſpake feelingly, experimentally in ſaying, <hi>when I am weak, then am I ſtrong.</hi> Strength is both ſown in weakneſs, groweth up in weakneſs, and is perfected in weakneſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Strength is ſown in weakneſs:</hi> In our weakneſs God ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his ſtrength: The time of weakening us, of pulling down our ſtrength is the time of ſowing Gods ſtrength in us. When God <hi>plows us up, makes long furrows in us,</hi> rents and tears up all that lives in us, then is his time of ſowing <hi>the ſeed of his own Life and Strength</hi> in us. Light is ſown in darkneſs, (the Light of Eternity is covered in the dark bowels of the Earth;) Life is ſown in death, Salvation is ſown in deſtruction, and ſtrength is ſown in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Strength grows in weakneſs:</hi> By growing weak a man grows ſtrong. A Chriſtian the more he is ſtripped of his own riches, the richer he grows; the more he is ſtripped of his own life, the more he grows in life; and the more he is ſtripped of his own ſtrength, the more he grows in ſtrength. There is nothing makes us weak but our own ſtrength, (the ſtrength of our enemies can only try, not any way impair our ſtrength;) therefore the taking of our ſtrength from us is the taking away of our weakneſs, it is the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of us from that which hindered the increaſing and thriving of true ſtrength in us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Strength is perfected in weakneſs:</hi> When weakneſs is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, ſtrength is perfected. As the ſhadow declines, and is made to give way, ſo the ſubſtance comes in and fills up its place; and when the ſhadow is quite gone, the ſubſtance comes wholly in, and then there is nothing to be found there but ſubſtance. Our ſtrength
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:165768:51"/>
is a ſhadow, a counterfeit of ſtrength, but not ſtrength indeed; it is the ſtrength of man, who is but weak himſelf in his whole frame and conſtitution, and what can his ſtrength be? Now as the ſtrength of the man, the ſhadowy ſtrength decayeth; ſo the ſtrength of God, true, ſubſtantial ſtrength grows up in him in the ſtead of it: And when all his ſtrength is quite ſpent, quite gone, utterly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; there will be no weakneſs left, nothing but perfect ſtrength <hi>(everlaſting ſtrength)</hi> remaining. The ſtrength of God hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hinder it ſelf in us, but our ſtrength: He hath nothing to hinder him, but the creature; (it is, as it was made, both a glaſs and a vail, to repreſent or hide him, as he himſelf pleaſeth to make uſe of it:) Nothing to hinder his Being, but the being of the creature; Nothing to hinder his Life, but the life of the creature; Nothing to hinder his Wiſdom, but the wiſdom of the creature; Nothing to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Strength, but the ſtrength of the creature: Where ever he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth theſe (as he wil do perfectly one day, <hi>in the great day, at the great battel of the Lord God Almighty</hi>) he himſelf fills up their room.</p>
            <p>O happy is he who hath drunk his full draught of death and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; for full Life, perfect Life and Happineſs cannot chuſe but ſpring up in him! <hi>Doth the plow-man plow all day to ſow?</hi> Doth God rent and teer in peeces for nothing? Do you think he cannot give an account of all the miſery and deſolation that lighteth upon his Creation? It is his more then its own, it ever was his, it ever will be his; it is but its own for a moment, yea it is his while it is its own, nay it is his in being its own: He hath made it, for a ſeaſon, to know and feel what it is to be its own; ſhall it never know and feel what it is to be his? It hath been long diſowned and caſt off by him, as if it were of no value, as if it had no relation to him, but ſhall this diſtance and ſtrangeneſs laſt for ever? It is true, he doth rent, teer, and make havock of it, and ſpeaketh terribly concerning future deſolations and miſeries which he will unavoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably bring upon it, and it doth not pleaſe him to give an account of his Ways, but tells proud man he doth it for his pleaſure; but he doth not tell him why it is his pleaſure, nor how long it ſhall be his pleaſure. Be ſilent then, and reſt here, Do not ſay that he hath no other pleaſure, thou knoweſt not the thoughts of his heart, thou knoweſt not what relation any thing hath unto him, nor how he will diſpoſe of it. <hi>He is what he is, He doth what
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:165768:51"/>
he doth, He will be what he will be, He will do what he will do,</hi> and he ſcorneth to let proud man know him in any thing. The light which he giveth him (without which he cannot ſo much as ſee after that poor, weak, ſilly manner that he doth) is but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool, to bewilder him, not to lead him to him. Man thinketh to be wiſe by his light, God by that very light maketh him a fool. It is light to him, but darkneſs in it ſelf: and what a fool is he whoſe light is darkneſs, whoſe wiſdom is folly, whoſe life is death, whoſe Heaven is Hell, whoſe God is the Devil, onely transformed at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent into <hi>an Angel of light</hi> to pleaſe the fool with appearing light, with his counterfeit light, which is but darkneſs, not light. O poor, ſhallow, deceived man, what a diſmal time is coming upon thee! <hi>a time of darkneſs, of darkneſs that may be felt, nay of darkneſs that cannot but be felt:</hi> Thou wilt not, thou canſt not now ſee and acknowledg thy darkneſs; No, it is light; but the time ſhall come that thou ſhalt not be able to avoyd ſeeing, and feeling and acknowledging it. <hi>The Sun</hi> that ſhines upon thee, by the light whereof thou yet ſeeſt, muſt be <hi>turned into darkneſs;</hi> and if thou wilt think to get a little light in that night by <hi>the Moon</hi> (if when the Sun is put out thou wouldſt be content to deſcend and make ſhift with the light of the Moon) thou ſhalt not neither, for that <hi>ſhall be turned into blood:</hi> That which was ſet up by God, under God, to give light unto man either in his day or in his night, ſhall go out; and there ſhall a day or night come upon him, wherein he ſhall be perfectly loſt, wherein he ſhall ſee and feel and know that he is a fool and cannot reach to the true underſtanding either of God, of himſelf, or of any thing elſe. Man thinks now he can attain any thing, there is nothing either in Heaven above or Earth beneath but he can underſtand in his proportion, according to what of it is repreſented to him, and according as he bends and applies himſelf to take in the knowledg of it, but <hi>the bryars and the thorns of the wilderneſs</hi> will teach him otherwiſe: When he is throughly <hi>brayed in the mortar,</hi> though his folly will not depart from him, yet his conceit of his wiſdom will fall. And what will then become of the life in him? (What would become of the life of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture if there were no Sun?) Where will be his knowledg of good and evil, wherewith he doth now ſo lift up himſelf, judging, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying or condemning as he pleaſeth? How will he reſiſt his enemies
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:165768:52"/>
or turn towards his friends, when he cannot ſee or diſtinguiſh ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Ah poor man, poor Chriſtian; How doth my ſpirit bewail that dreadful captivity, which thou doſt not ſo much as dream of, yet muſt drink deep of! There is no avoyding it: it is the Lords intereſt to put out thy light, to put out thy life, and it muſt not be ſpared.</p>
            <p>There is a double Captivity <hi>hastening, haſtening, coming on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, very ſwiftly,</hi> (though man may account the Lords haſte ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:) A captivity of the whole Creation, a captivity of all Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a captivity of the old Creature, a captivity of the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; a captivity of the ſeed of man; a captivity of the ſeed of God; a captivity of the fleſh, a captivity of the ſpirit; a captivity of the old creaturely life, (of the reaſon, wiſdom, underſtanding of the creature) a captivity of the new regenerate life (of the life of God ſown in the creature.) I ſhall onely give a glance at the latter of theſe, becauſe it is here pointed at, and is firſt to take place: for God will begin with his people, <hi>God ſhall judg his people, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt begin at the houſe of God;</hi> and the other captivity (the captivity of the Creature) may go hand in hand with this in them, ſo that their whole captivity perhaps may be wholly ended before God begins with the world: They ſhall <hi>lift up their heads, becauſe their redemption draweth nigh,</hi> when deſtruction is but coming upon others: God will ſay to them; <hi>Ariſe, ſhine, thy light is come, the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee,</hi> when he is but rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>the cloud of darkneſs,</hi> yea of <hi>groſs darkneſs</hi> to cover the earth and the people of the earth with. But as they muſt riſe before the world, ſo they muſt dye before the world; they muſt dye while man remains alive, that they may live when death iſſueth forth to ſeize upon man: And as <hi>their Life and Reſurrection</hi> is far more excellent then ever man can attain to, ſo is <hi>their Death and Captivity</hi> far more bitter. To touch a little at it.</p>
            <p>There is a captivity, a great captivity which the ſpiritual life is ſubject unto before it entereth into perfect reſt.</p>
            <p>Whether this ſhall befall any in the body or out of the body, I know not, (God knoweth:) for I know not the way of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the body, nor the way of the ſpirit out of the body. Yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemeth expreſly to affirm concerning ſome, that they ſhould <hi>be ſaved in the Day of the Lord</hi> (which is the proper time of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:165768:52"/>
               <hi>yet ſo as by fire:</hi> Their <hi>works</hi> ſhould not be able to endure <hi>the fire</hi> (many of them) but ſhould be burnt up; yet they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (notwithſtanding their loſs by the burning up of their works) ſhould be ſaved, yet not perhaps as they think, but <hi>ſo as by fire.</hi> The Soul muſt be purified, throughly purified, perfectly purified, before it enjoy God: it muſt paſs through the fire, and if it be not able to endure the fire, it cannot but ſuffer by it both <hi>pain and loſs.</hi> Sin may be taken away by imputation, but the work of renovation is not ſo either begun or perfected, but by often caſting into the fire, and by often molding in the fire, where the very powers of life are melted and transformed, by ſeveral ſteps and degrees, into perfection; and the proceſs and growth into life is ſtill according to the force and degree of death. I have nothing to ſay concerning a place of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> (which the Papiſts ſpeak of) but in this I know not how to be otherwiſe minded, but that the Soul muſt be throughly purged of all its droſs before it enter into perfect union and communion with God; and the Apoſtle ſeemeth to intimate that ſome ſhall not be ſo purged until <hi>the Day of the Lord,</hi> which is the proper time for the letting out of that fire for the tryal of all things: And when the Tryal is, then muſt needs the ſuffering be of that which is not able to bear the Tryal, although in the reſult it ſhould be ſaved; <hi>he himſelf ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. If we obſerve mens departure out of the body, there are few ſeem ſo purged but that they have ſtill need of the fire: How far that Thief was changed upon the Croſs, or what is wrought in men at the point of death, or what becomes of them immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, I have nothing to ſay concerning; yet the general appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, of ſuch an immediate entering into perfect reſt, would not to me carry ſufficient clearneſs if I ſhould go about to ſcan things as a man: But to let that paſs.</p>
            <p>There is, I ſay, a great captivity for the ſpiritual life to be tryed in and by to the purpoſe, before it be entruſted with Reſt, before it be admitted into the poſſeſſion of perfect and unchangeable Reſt. There may be an entering into <hi>the Land of Canaan,</hi> yea a ſetling in and an enjoying of it, and yet after that a going into captivity. <hi>We, who beleeve, have entered into Reſt, Paul</hi> deeply entered, and yet here is a kinde of captivity afterwards; he was <hi>buffeted by a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger from Satan,</hi> and his ſpirit very reſtleſs under it: And though
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:165768:53"/>
his be but a type or taſte of the captivity, not the captivity it ſelf, yet it may ſerve to point at it. The <hi>Jews</hi> were Types of <hi>the true Iſrael, Canaan</hi> a Type of their Reſt, and the captivities of the <hi>Jews</hi> Types of the captivities of their ſpirits: To have a ſpirit wounded is very bitter, what is it to have a ſpirit in captivity, where it is continually wounding (nothing but wounded) at the pleaſure of its greateſt enemy?</p>
            <p>There are two things in this Captivity pointed at here, as in a figure. The nature of it, and the helpleſſneſs of the ſpirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The nature of it,</hi> which conſiſts in <hi>a ſubjection to the Devil.</hi> The perſon, who was delivered from him, ſnatched out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſet free from his yoke of Tyranny, ſeated in its own land; is thruſt out of its own land and put into the hands of the Devil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: he is brought back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> concerning which it was ſaid unto him that he ſhould return no more thither: He is bound and carryed into <hi>Babylon,</hi> yea beyond <hi>Babylon</hi> (there is a Captivity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Babylon) I will carry you beyond Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Subjection there are divers things conſiderable, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it to be very hard and bitter. 1. There is the weakening of this life, the drying up of the life of the ſpirit. When we lie under the influences of God, this life is quickened, revived and cheriſhed; but when we are in the Devils priſon, (layd in bonds by him) he nips this life, blows upon it, doth as much as he can to extinguiſh it: And how bitter, how painful is it to a ſpiritual man, to finde his ſpiritual life dying and decaying!</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſtopping the courſe of it: And this were death it ſelf (if there were no more added) to have the activity of this life choked, it being ſo full of motion, and ſo active in every motion. The whole current of this life is ſtopped: it can do nothing that it would; it wants its light, it wants its ſtrength, it wants that which was wont to ſet it agoing, it wants oyl. <hi>In this Captivity, the night is come, wherein none can work.</hi> Spiritual actions and motions are of a curious nature, requiring much skill, care, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs; requiring a great deal of pure, clear light; how can they be wrought in the night! They require ſtrength, how can the Soul effect them in ſo great weakneſs as its Captivity expoſeth it unto? They require liberty, how can the Soul ſet about them in bonds?
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:165768:53"/>
Nor will the Devil ſuffer any ſuch works (of <hi>Light, Life,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi>) to be wrought in his Kingdom: If we would <hi>ſing the Lords Song in a ſtrange Land,</hi> he would not permit it. He is Maſter over us in our Captivity, he hath our ſpirit ſo bound with his chain, that we can ſtir no whither, do nothing without his leave. I tell you Sirs, it is as impoſſible to beleeve, to hope, to wait, to rejoyce in God, nay to ſubmit to God in this Captivity, as it is for the man who was never yet brought out of his Kingdom: Life wholly ſhut up cannot at all ſtir abroad, Life wholly bound up can no more act then Death it ſelf, then that which never was nor ever knew life. 'Tis true, there are Captivities wherein theſe things may be done; but I ſpeak now of the great Captivity, and of the depth of that Captivity too; for both at the going in and upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out ſome of theſe things may perhaps be poſſible.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is the drawing forth of the perſon into contrary ways and acts of death. He is not onely hindered from doing what he would, but he is made to do what he would not. He is not onely forcibly kept from ſerving <hi>his own Liege Lord,</hi> but he is made to ſerve the Devil, who delights to put him upon ſuch motions as are moſt contrary to his former life, and to his preſent moſt inward ſpiritual nature: He is a perfect Tyrant, will ſtill be putting his ſlave to that which may be moſt irkſom to him, and which may moſt manifeſt his own dominion over him. And here I could relate ſome ſtrange things, which I have heard of one that hath felt, how (in the time of his Captivity) he never reſolved againſt any thing, nor ſtrongly deſired to avoyd any thing, but he was ſure to be forced into it; and found this his greateſt relief and ſafety to lie perfectly open to all manner of weakneſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is hard uſage under all this, buffetings, blows, ſharp ſtrokes upon the ſpirit; (He deals like the Turks with their Gally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves, beats them whether they work or no;) He uſeth all manner of Tyranny towards them, is not pleaſed with any thing they can do, but hateth them perfectly, and doth them all the miſchief he can, becauſe of that life in them which ſtill lives in the root, and ſhall break forth again in branches, leaves and fruit for all this. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he who was never out of his clutches may have ſome fair quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from his hands, but he who is brought back again (with the life in him) muſt expect to feel the utmoſt that his malice is ſuffered to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:165768:54"/>
do, unleſs he will yeeld (as many ſhall, and extremity will much urge all, and over-bear the ſtrongeſt reſolutions of ſtanding out) and come under his banner, and then he ſhall have light enough, and ſtrength enough and pleaſure enough in his ſervice: but this they cannot do, becauſe their nature ſteereth them otherwiſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt undergo the brunt.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The ſpirits helpleſſneſs under it,</hi> or the ineffectualneſs of all means that can be uſed towards Redemption or towards mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the rigor of this Captivity; there is a taſte of that here too, <hi>for this I prayed thrice; Paul</hi> uſed all his ſtrength in prayer, all his intereſt in God, but it would not avail, he muſt bear theſe buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetings. So is it in this Captivity, it muſt have its courſe; pray ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo hard, the cup will neither paſs from you nor ſo much as one drop be abated: It is not poſſible for this cup or the leaſt portion of it to paſs from the deareſt ones of God. This is Chriſts cup, he drank all his ſhare, and every one muſt drink all theirs. And the phyſick, as it is very ſtrong, ſo it will make them very ſick, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtleſs and helpleſs. Chriſt was ſo, he knew not which way to turn him: He knew none but God could help him, and he could not reach him nor make any prayer come neer him; <hi>O my God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I cry in the day time, but thou heareſt not; and in the night ſeaſon, and there is no ſilence to me:</hi> And it will make every one (though the life of Chriſt be in them) ſick, reſtleſs, helpleſs, as it did Chriſt. The Soul cannot tell which way to turn, in any one motion, for the leaſt eaſe, all the time of its Captivity: Run to the Scriptures, run to Experiences, think of the Nature of God, its Intereſt in God, &amp;c. all is dead, all is dark, all is confounded; there is nothing now can be looked upon but as it is repreſented in the Kingdom of Darkneſs, as it is poyſoned by the Devil, and ſo tends but further to poyſon and torment the Soul: And the more it thinks on theſe, the more it feeds on theſe, the more it ſeeks relief from theſe; the more it ſucks in that which ſtill adminiſters freſh anguiſh and death unto it. If it be never ſo hungry, it can come at no food; if it be never ſo thirſty, it can come at no drink, except <hi>vineger and gall,</hi> not one crumb of <hi>the bread of life,</hi> not one drop of <hi>the water of life</hi> is to be heard of here. This is not the place for life either to live or act in; nay there is nothing is an occaſion of greater Torment to the Soul in the time of this Captivity, then
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:165768:54"/>
its ſtriving to live and move ſpiritually; as to beleeve, love, pray, hope, wait, or the like: For hereby,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It occaſions a calling to minde the former ſweetneſs of theſe, its former activity in theſe (which are now become ſo difficult, ſo impoſſible to it:) and a lively remembrance of the ſweetneſs of what was formerly enjoyed, doth much encreaſe the trouble of the preſent want of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It encreaſeth the ſenſe of the preſent bitterneſs, by making it more lively. It doth not onely encreaſe the ſenſe of the want of theſe, but encreaſeth alſo the ſenſe of that which lieth upon the ſpirit. The remembrance of former life and liberty, makes the preſent bonds and pangs of death a great deal more ſharp and weighty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It encreaſeth the Devils rage, that he now layeth load upon the Soul. To finde that life yet ſtriving to ſtir which he hath bound ſo faſt, this makes him ſeek for new cords to binde it yet faſter, for ſtronger poyſon to ſtrike it yet more dead. Now if I ſhould tell you of a ſtrange Myſtery, <hi>viz.</hi> of embracing this ſubjection, of putting your necks under <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> girdle, of receiving quietly all the buffetings of Satan; (not onely of entering again willingly into your Captivity, but of bearing your whole burden in your Captivity) of letting your life, hope, ſtrength and all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death and be layd in the grave; if I ſhould ſpeak after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to you, ye would ſay this were a very hard doctrine: yet this is certain, that the Bird in the Cage doth but tire (yea perhaps bruiſe and hurt) it ſelf by fluttering to get out, or the Bird in the net or ſnare doth but entangle it ſelf more by ſtraining to get looſe and fly abroad. There is no way like to lying ſtill, and yeelding up even the ſpiritual life as a ſacrifice, following Chriſt as a Lamb or Sheep to the ſlaughter without the leaſt reſiſtance, gainſaying, or relucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>O ſad, ſad, ſad will this Captivity be! Never was there deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, deſolation and anguiſh like unto it! Then ſhall every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber feel the pains of the head, and then ſhall every member (ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted) complain with the head, and ſay; <hi>Is it nothing to you, all ye that paſs by? behold and ſee, if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted me, in the day of his fierce anger. From above hath he ſent
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:165768:55"/>
fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath ſpred a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and faint all the day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when this Captivity is ended, when life ſhall again come forth from under this bondage; O how ſweet, how freſh, how pure will it be! how pleaſant to look back upon the ſeveral yokes, bonds, ſnares, deaths in the Land of our Captivity! Then we ſhall glory more in thoſe multiplyed deaths, then in our former life. Our former life and enjoyments tended but to lead us to Captivity; but this Captivity tends to lead us to that Life which cannot enter into Captivity, which cannot feel Captivity, but will be maſter of it where ere it meets it. Our life led us into that Captivity where we felt unutterable anguiſh, death, miſery; but our Captivity lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to that Life which is ſo ſtrong and vigorous, that it is able <hi>to lead Captivity captive</hi> even in its own Land.</p>

            <p>THat which God created, was <hi>fleſh:</hi> He brought forth every thing, in this Creation, in a ſtate of weakneſs: All the Images and repreſentations of himſelf here are fleſhly; The eye he made to behold them, was a fleſhly eye; The content, the happineſs that cometh by this ſight, is a fleſhly happineſs; The enjoyment of God in this way, is a fleſhly enjoyment. There was emptineſs, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, vanity written in the very ſtate yea in the very make of the Creation: Indeed it might have enjoyed a kinde of happineſs, if it
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:165768:55"/>
had remained as it was made, but it would not have been true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, nor could it have laſted: It was as impoſſible for <hi>Adam</hi> to have ſtood, as it is for God to fall; for there was mortality, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability written in his ſtate, in his nature, as there is Eternity, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability written in Gods. <hi>Adams</hi> nature diſpoſed him to what befell him, it was fleſh, walked in the path of fleſh, haſtening towards the end deſigned unto fleſh.</p>

               <hi>Henceforth know we no man after the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The eye, the created eye, the eye of this Creation in its beſt, in its pureſt, in its perfecteſt ſtate, is no better then fleſhly.</p>
            <p>This eye, as it is fleſhly, ſo that which this eye ſeeth, is fleſh; it can ſee nothing which is ſpiritual. The eye of ſence cannot ſee the reaſon of man, nor can the reaſon of man ſee the Nature of God. Man may ſee God, as the creatures ſee man, (not comprehending, not underſtanding him:) He may ſee the fleſhly part of God, the fleſhly appearance, but not the ſpiritual Subſtance; He may ſee out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward viſible Demonſtrations of God, but not his Nature, not his Spirit, which alone is God.</p>
            <p>The manner after which this eye ſeeth, is fleſhly; after a weak, ſhallow, fleſhly manner, not comprehending, not piercing into things, not gathering things into it ſelf, but by gathering deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and concluſions from principles and experiences; this is mans way.</p>

            <p>There is a parcel of this Creation, in whom Eternity, in whom the ſeed of another-gheſs life (then this Creation is acquainted with, or can comprehend) is ſown; in whom this Creation is in part pulled down, and the Foundations of Eternity laid in the ruines of it. All things are not one, all things are not alike, do not your ſenſes perceive a vaſt difference in things? There is an inward world, and there are inward ſenſes, which have felt, and can tell you that the difference there is more vaſt, and more ſubſtantial. In this world ye ſee that excellent things are rare: there is abundance of droſs, but little pure mettal in compariſon; abundance of ſtones, but pearls are not ſo common; abundance of chaff and off all, but not ſo much pure ſeed: So is it in the inward world; <hi>The jewels of God, the grain of God, the ſeed of his own Spirit</hi> is very ſcarce and precious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:165768:56"/>
               <hi>We know.</hi> As there is ſuch a ſeed, ſo they have a life and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg ſuitable to them: and indeed their knowledg is the only knowledg, before which all the knowledg of man vaniſheth and ſhrinketh away like a ſhadow. It is true, man hath knowledg, man hath life, if ye ſpeak in one kind of language; but if ye ſpeak <hi>in a pure language</hi> he hath not: He doth know God, he doth live in God, he doth live to God in a ſenſe, in a ſhadowy life and knowledg (and ſo do other creatures in a ſenſe too, in a more dark and more ſhadowy life and knowledg,) but in truth he doth not. But <hi>we know,</hi> this ſeed, this man (the new man) doth know; his is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and ſhall appear knowledg when it cometh to be tried: when the day comes, and the ſhadows fly away, this ſhall ſtand and remain; <hi>we know.</hi> He that is <hi>born of God,</hi> he that feeds upon and grows up in the Life of God, he doth indeed know: He that ſees with his eye, in his light, ſees truth, ſees himſelf, and that not any way painted, but in his own native nakedneſs, beauty and excellency. But all other eyes, all other lights, all other ſights of things with theſe eyes in or through theſe lights, are but ſhadows, tend but to hide and deceive, and after their appointed ſeaſon is over, muſt paſs away. Man muſt dye, his eye be cloſed at the time of his death, after which it can ſee no more, and then muſt he into the grave, and all his light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg be buried with him.</p>
            <p>Go on, O Man; ſtudy the creatures, ſtudy the Scriptures, gather a ſtock of knowledg and experience from theſe; Admire God, love God, live in God, live to God, be perfect, walk exactly with God. This is knowledg, this is life, this is excellency, (I cannot but give it its due<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) as I am a man, I love it; and O how is my heart taken with the perſon in whom I find this vigorous! But again, This is not knowledg, this is not life, this muſt periſh, and thou with it; This will not ſave thee, but kindle the flames upon thee, and help the more to ſcortch thee: And if I do not know this more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then thou knoweſt any thing, let me be proved a Lyar, and ſhamed before the whole bulk of mankind, for ſo unjuſtly arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, accuſing and condeming man ſo long and ſo deeply in mine own ſpirit, and now at length ſo publiquely in open view.</p>

            <p>This Seed of God, who are begotten and born of God, who live in the Life of God, who walk in the Light of God, they ſee nothing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:165768:56"/>
after the manner of men, they know nothing as man knows. It is not by reaſon or experience, by the ſight of the eye, or hearing of the ear, that they come to underſtand, but by the ſpringing up of their own life in them. Indeed while the man remains in them, he will be knowing (even ſpiritual things) as other men know them, and making uſe of them as other men make uſe of them; but this is not the life in them that doth thus. The Life only knows it ſelf, and it only knows by it ſelf, by its own living it comes to know. There is light ſown every where in <hi>this life;</hi> and as the light grows, the life ſpringeth up in it. They need nothing to make them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect but the perfect growth of their own life; they need nothing elſe to teach them, to guide them, to refreſh them; all that they can deſire, dwells in that life which they already have. They are like God (his Seed cannot but have his likeneſs) their happineſs, their perfection lieth in themſelves, in their own life. They <hi>walk in the light as he is in the light,</hi> the knowledg, the fellowſhip they have with things is by feeling them in their own ſpirits: They know God by feeling him there, and they know other things by comprehending them there in God, in whom they are originally, and moſt fully.</p>

All his Preachings, all his Miracles, all his outward Manifeſtations of the Power, Goodneſs and Love of God in theſe, were but fleſhly Manifeſtations; and he who thus knew him, knew him but by theſe, knew him but <hi>after the fleſh.</hi> Chriſt, as he was here in a fleſhly ſtate, ſo he had a fleſhly knowledg of God, and held forth a fleſhly knowledg of God, which was uſeful to him, and might be alſo to others in the ſeaſon of it; but it paſſed away with him (he dyed to it, and is to live no more to it) and with his Apoſtles after him in part, and muſt paſs away in all, in whom the other ſeed is ſown, according as that comes to live in them.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:165768:57"/>
man did much live in us, and we knew by outward receptions of Light, and by viſible demonſtrations of Power. While the ſeed is young and tender, the weeds are ſuffered to grow up with it, that it might alſo grow: If you ſhould at firſt pluck up all the knowledg of the man, ye could not but pluck up the knowledg of God too, which is weak, and as it were hangs upon it; but let them both alone, let them both grow till it hath taken thorow rooting, and then it will keep its ground, and be able to bear the violence of the ſeparation. Let but the New-Man grow ſtrong and hearty enough he will ſpue up the other of himſelf; <hi>henceforth know we no man after the fleſh; yea though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now henceforth know we him no more:</hi> Not as if <hi>Paul</hi> or any elſe then had perfectly attained unto this, but life in him and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers was working apace towards this, and had in part alſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>And now let me tell thee, O Man, if thou canſt bear to hear it, that though thou haſt a great deal of knowledg in thy kind; yet not one dram of true knowledg, not one grain of knowledg in the right kind. Thou canſt not read aright one line throughout the whole Creation, nor one tittle of the Book of God. Thou doſt not know God, or the creatures, or (that which thou thinkeſt cannot but be known) that God made the creatures. Thou doſt not know ſin, or the Law whereby ſin is ſin, or Chriſt who is the Redeemer from ſin. That which thou calleſt the knowledg of theſe things, (which indeed thou haſt) is not knowledg; and when they come to be opened <hi>in the light of the Lord</hi> (which ſhall put out thy light, and diſcover thy darkneſs, which is now painted as if it were light) thou ſhalt find thou doſt not know them. Thou art ſo far from Redemption, that thou never kneweſt what ſin was, even thou who canſt talk of ſin, and ſeemeſt to thy ſelf to be able to open it in the ſeveral kinds, natures and degrees of it. Ah poor periſhing man, how wilt thou be deluded in thy hopes of Salvation! <hi>Thy ways are the ways of death,</hi> all thy motions <hi>towards God, towards Life, towards Happineſs</hi> (as thou thinkeſt) are but ſo many ſteps from it: Thou doſt but dream of things in the night, (and it is not much material whether thy dreams pleaſe or diſturb thy fancy, for which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be it is but imaginary, thy very certainty is imaginary,) but fetcheſt not one ſtep in the light, and when thou awakeſt, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:165768:57"/>
comeſt to behold the vanity of thy dreams, O how ſick wilt thou be of them! Thou walk towards happineſs, O Man? thou canſt not ſo much as deſire happineſs: (Thou canſt not but deſire hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and yet thou canſt not for thy heart deſire happineſs:) As thou comeſt from the fleſh, ſo thou centereſt in the fleſh, and fain wouldſt come to reſt in a fleſhly happineſs from God, but thou wouldſt chuſe to go to Hell rather then come near true Life, which will, one day, be more tormenting to thee then all the Hells thou canſt imagine. O how tormenting is <hi>the Life and Love of God</hi> to every thing but it ſelf! tormenting in its nature, tormenting in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motion of it. Every creature can imagine an excellency in his life, in his love; but none can groundedly acknowledg it, nay none can bear it: They call that ſo (and can very well bear that) which they fancy in him, (if God were that which man imagines him to be, he could not but love him and honour him exceedingly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the greateſt intimacy and communion with him,) but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call that ſo which is ſo in him, for when they come near it their very ſenſe and experience will undenyably evidence it to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to them. <hi>Wiſdom cryeth aloud</hi> to thee, O Man, ſhe hath long <hi>uttered her voyce in thy ſtreets;</hi> but thou canſt not hear nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand her language, <hi>the way of life thou canſt not know: The light ſhineth in thy darkneſs, but thy darkneſs cannot comprehend it;</hi> therefore muſt thou dye in thy blindneſs and folly, while <hi>WIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM laughs at thy destruction, and mocks when thy fear cometh.</hi> This is thy Judgment written, which will at length overtake thee, how skilful ſoever thou art at preſent to put it far from thee.</p>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:165768:58"/>
planting and plucking up, killing and healing, breaking down and building, weeping and laughing, mourning and dancing, &amp;c. the world paſſeth away. Some come in, ſome go out; Some plant, ſome pluck up; Some kill, ſome heal; Some break down, ſome build; Some weep, ſome laugh; Some mourn, ſome dance, &amp;c. Yea the very ſame perſons have their ſeveral ſeaſons, to go forth in theſe ſeveral motions ſo contrary one to another. Man is ordained to walk retrograde to himſelf, to go quite contrary ways, to fetch contrary ſteps, to throw down all that he builds, to build all that he throws down, to go ſo many degrees of death as he hath gone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of life, to run through ſo many paſſages in the dark world as he hath gone through in the light World, one while to make himſelf an univerſal tranſgreſſor, and anon to juſtifie himſelf in all his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, (and he is but a vain fool in all; a fool living a fool dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; a fool planting, a fool plucking up; a fool killing, a fool heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; a fool weeping, a fool laughing; a fool making himſelf a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a fool making himſelf a Saint.) There is no man hath ſo much life and ſo much pleaſure allotted to him, but he muſt taſte death an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable: and there is no man undergoeth and runneth through ſo much <hi>miſery, anguiſh, grief, trouble,</hi> but he ſhall have <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, joy, reſt, peace, content</hi> anſwerable when his ſeaſon comes, when thoſe ſuperior Orbs which carry theſe influences in them are circumvolved by that power which moveth them, and produceth theſe effects by them.</p>
            <p>There is an <hi>inward World</hi> much like this outward, (it is the Copy after which this was drawn;) There are ſuch <hi>Elements</hi> in it as in this, after the ſame manner compounded, by the ſame art and skill; There are <hi>creatures</hi> there of the ſame manner of make as theſe here: There is <hi>an inward man</hi> to govern this inward world: There are the ſame <hi>ſeaſons</hi> of night and day, Winter and Summer (with the ſeveral concomitants of each, and with the ſeveral alterations in each) which have their force &amp; influences upon the inward man and the inward world, as theſe here have upon the outward, (but none of all the Beings in this inward world hath any ſight or underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſtate of things here but the inward man, as none of all the creatures have any underſtanding of the ſtate of this outward world but the outward man, though every outward thing hath its place and ſtate in it, yet unknown to it ſelf, none here knoweth either
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:165768:59"/>
where it is, or what it is, but man, or rather in that manner that man doth, for man doth it not truly neither.) There are here alſo <hi>winds,</hi> ſome nipping, ſome cheriſhing; and <hi>rains,</hi> ſome refreſhing, ſome overflowing and drowning. There is likewiſe here <hi>a Sun to rule and give light by day, and a Moon and Stars to give light by night.</hi> And this world hath its courſe juſt like the outward; it begins with Life, firſt traverſing the ſeveral paths of it, and then runs backward retiring into the chambers and degrees of death. And herein will God deceive the thoughts and expectations of all men, both the inward man and the outward man: for the inward world ſhall dye and paſs away ſo as the inward man could never imagine it poſſible, and the outward world ſhall live and remain ſo as the outward man could never imagine it poſſible: The one ſhall meet with ſuch a death as it never dreamed of, and the other with ſuch a life as it never dreamed of: The one (for all the vigour of its life) ſhall not find it ſelf able to live out of God, when the time of its remove and ſeparation comes; and the other (for all its weakneſs) ſhall find it ſelf able to live in God, when it is taken into him. There is nothing ſo weak, ſo imperfect; but God can make it taſte of ſtrength, of perfection: There is nothing ſo ſtrong, ſo perfect; but God can make it taſte of weakneſs and imperfection. There was nothing ever born, planted, built up, &amp;c. but may have a time to dye, to be plucked up, to be thrown down, &amp;c. There was nothing ever deaded, plucked up, raſed out; but may have a time to be quickened, to be planted, to be written in again.</p>
            <p>All things are brought forth in weakneſs, the inward world as well as the outward: <hi>All things under the Sun there are vanity,</hi> are to have but <hi>a vain courſe,</hi> and to end in <hi>vexation of ſpirit.</hi> God indeed is perfect in every motion of his both in the inward and in the outward world, (<hi>I know that whatſoever he doth, it ſhall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it,</hi> Verſ. 14.) But man is weak, man is vain, the outward man vain, the inward man vain; every motion of his comes to nothing: He ſeemeth to be wonderous wiſe, to have motions of great weight (even of Eternity) upon him, but alas he cannot reach Eternity, he is but a vain empty cipher which ſtands for nothing: He hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in him: but his purpoſes are poor ſhallow things, and there is a ſeaſon for them, wherein he takes his ſwinge in them, but theſe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:165768:59"/>
ſeaſons muſt blow over too, and the time muſt come wherein man muſt be ripped up with all his hurdle of vanity from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the end, and then both he and it blown away with the wind; an eternal puff will quickly ſet them all packing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What profit hath he that worketh, in that wherein he laboreth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O God, Let others treaſure up, but I abhor, I throw away every inward motion that ever hath ſprung up from me! I will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to delight in, nothing to glory in, nothing to hope from before thee. Do thou gather them up and ſave them as they are thine (as thou haſt been and appeared in them) but as mine let them paſs away for evermore. Let there be no profit of all my labour and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. Do thou reap <hi>the travel of thy Soul and be ſatisfied;</hi> but for my part I have long turned, and ſtill do, and cannot but turn from all the works of my hands, all the delights of my ſpirit, even in the inward world, and with as perfect irkſomneſs and tiredneſs of ſpirit, as ever <hi>Solomon</hi> did from his in the outward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He hath made every thing beautiful in his time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every thing is beautiful in its ſeaſon, and nothing is lovely out of its ſeaſon. There's a beauty in <hi>life,</hi> O how lovely is <hi>the ſpring</hi> both in the inward and outward world! The life of the fleſh, the life of the ſpirit, each ſhoots forth with a grace. And there's a beauty in <hi>death,</hi> it is comely to ſee things dye when the ſeaſon of death comes. There is nothing ſo black but there is beauty written in it, nothing ſo evil but it hath goodneſs engraven on it; Nothing ſo bad but it is good in its own place, order, ſeaſon, courſe; nothing ſo good but it is bad out of its place: There's a beauty in killing, and a beauty in healing; a beauty in weeping, and a beauty in laughing, &amp;c. in their ſeaſons, but of their ſeaſons they are very deformed.</p>
            <p>All the motions of God, both in the inward and in the outward world, are very exact; They have all reference one to another, the outward to the inward, the inward to the outward, every motion in each hath an univerſal aſpect and referrence, there is a ſtrain of Eternity in every motion: There is the very Nature and Excellency of God in every thing that God doth, every thing as it comes from him ſavours and taſtes of his own Perfection. Man hath but a poor ſight of things, either the outward or inward man, and after that manner that he ſees he doth not ſee either from the beginning or to the end of any thing: The outward man ſeeth not any outward
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:165768:60"/>
thing ſo, nor doth the inward man ſee any inward thing ſo. And indeed <hi>God hath ſo ſet the world in mans heart,</hi> that man cannot be left free and unbyaſſed in obſervation and judgment: There is ſuch a deſire, planted in man, to graſp and enjoy what ever is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered (every thing in the outward world there is a deſire in the outward man to poſſeſs, every thing in the inward world there is a deſire in the inward man to poſſeſs) that man cannot addict and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf to underſtand things, to obſerve the motion and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God in things from the beginning to the end. There is nothing ſeen in the root, either as it lies in the root, or as it ſprings out of the root, or as it returns into the root: Man hath only a bruitiſh knowledg of things, or of the motions and actions of God in and about things, ſeeing only a preſent appearance of this or that, but not knowing what it is, whence it came, what it means, or whither it tends. And this alſo is <hi>beautiful in its ſeaſon;</hi> Darkneſs becomes the night, (ſpiritual darkneſs the ſpiritual night) as light becomes the day: and ſhadows and lyes are as proper for the night, as Truth and ſubſtance is for the day. While the night remains it is as ſuitable that the ſhadows ſhould remain alſo, as that <hi>when the day dawns the ſhadows</hi> ſhould <hi>fly away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here is the Excellency of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>Sion,</hi> of <hi>the holy Seed,</hi> They are not exempted from any varieties or changes either in the inward or outward world, but in their running through them they ſtill remain the ſame. They are like God; Every where, in every thing, what ever their clothes, what ever their appearances be, yet <hi>their Subſtance, their Life</hi> is ſtill the ſame. The <hi>inward man</hi> ſhall be befooled (all his light be put out, and he made to ſee and confeſs that he knoweth nothing) as well as the outward, it is <hi>the ſpiritual man</hi> only (whether in the ſeed or grown up) that ſhall live and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: And for the coming of this day my Soul, after its own hidden way and manner, waiteth and longeth, the breaking forth whereof is alone able to afford my ſpirit reſt and ſatisfaction.</p>

            <p>A <hi>Portion</hi> is the childs ſhare in his fathers eſtate, containing in it preſent proviſion for him, education according to his quality and degree, and a proportion of ſubſtance for him afterwards to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy and inherit as his fathers eſtate will bear, and as his fathers good will ſtandeth towards him.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath his children, and he (according to the bond of the relation) provides portions for them, ſhares out his own eſtate
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:165768:61"/>
among them, taketh care of them, both to furniſh them with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, and to bring them up (by education ſuitable to their rank) in the time of their nonage, and hath cut out an inheritance for them, which he will freely beſtow upon them when they come to age, which he hath divided and diſpoſed of partly according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own eſtate, partly according to the diſpoſition and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his own Will.</p>
            <p>Now this Portion is <hi>the Lord himſelf.</hi> As he hath cut out his people for himſelf, <hi>(the Lords Portion is his People, Jacob is the lot of his Inheritance:)</hi> So he hath cut out himſelf for his Peoples Portion, <hi>the Lord is my Portion, ſaith my Soul.</hi> For every thing that is made he hath made proviſion, but his own Seed hath he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for himſelf, and himſelf for his Seed. They come from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God, they live upon nothing but God, they can expect nothing but God: He is all their ſhare, all that ever was intended or appointed for them, all they have, all they can enjoy, all they are to look for.</p>
            <p>And as God knows this, ſo his Seed have a knowledg of this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: When they are grown up to underſtanding they come to ſee whoſe they are, from whence they came, to whom they belong, what their life and hope is. Their relation, and all that belongs to them, is written in their very nature, which when they come to be ſo skilful as to read, they cannot but take notice of.</p>
            <p>But in their Captivity their light and their life is buried, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God vailed, they removed at a diſtance from him: He ſevers them from him as if they belonged not to him, he acteth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them as if he knew them not, he letteth all kind of miſery and diſtreſs befall them as if he took no care of them at all; ſo that the poor Soul loſeth all ſight of him, all viable vertue from him, yea and intereſt in him, cannot tell how to lay any hold of him: Yet for all this there remains a deep inward ſenſe of this thing, and the heart ſecretly, inwardly (in ſuch a manner as perhaps the perſon himſelf cannot diſtinguiſh the ſound) ſaith, <hi>the Lord is my Portion.</hi> I have no ſhare in any thing but God; nothing can help me, nothing can relieve me, nothing can refreſh me but God: And I have a ſhare in him, he will yet look after me, <hi>(I ſhall yet ſee him, who is the health of my countenance and my God,)</hi> he will yet be Life unto me, and Spirit in me; <hi>The Lord is my Portion, ſaith my Soul.</hi>

If it can but look at any time into its own heart, it ſhall hear this kind of language; <hi>Nothing can relieve me but God, Nothing can mitigate my miſery but God, Nothing can ſatisfie my tormenting love, my ſcortching deſire, but the full enjoyment of God; therefore there is all the hope I have:</hi> I may be made to ſearch up and down by the force of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; I may be perſwaded to try this way and that way, and the other way, but I have no manner of expectation from them, I cannot hope in them, I will not hope in them, <hi>I will hope in him.</hi> He is all my ſhare, my only ſhare; my help, my relief lies there or no where, from thence muſt I have it, or no where at all, and thither alone will I have recourſe, upon him will I hang for it.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 25. <hi>The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the Soul that ſeeketh him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two ſon-like tempers or kinds of motion in the ſpirit of this child towards his Father, in his Fathers withdrawing and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence for him; which are to wait for him, and to ſeek after him. He waits and he ſeeks, he ſeeks and he waits. Fain would he find him, and therefore he ſeeks; and yet he would not have him come afore his own time, and therefore he waits for his appointed ſeaſon: He waits for a full enjoyment of him, he ſeeks for preſent food and ſupport. Thoſe that know not God can neither wait nor ſeek: but thoſe that have this life in them can forbear neither, for their nature is pointed towards it, their nature puts them into, and keeps them in that poſture, it is the proper courſe and current of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which cannot be ſtopped while their nature remains: If it were poſſible, by the thickneſs of darkneſs, and extremity of miſery, to drive them into the greateſt hatred of theſe, and ſtrongeſt reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt theſe, yet their ſpirits would return again to their courſe, yea in the very midſt hereof have their ſecret current through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret channels (though perhaps untaken notice of by themſelves) in theſe. To what parpoſe is it to wait, to what purpoſe is it to ſeek, ſaith the fleſh and the fleſhly birth? Yes it is to purpoſe, ſaith the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:165768:62"/>
Spirit and the ſpiritual Child, for <hi>the Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the Soul that ſeeketh him.</hi> It is not in vain to wait for God, for the goodneſs and kindneſs of God, to ſeek him, or what our ſpirits want from him; <hi>The Lord is good</hi> to ſuch. You cannot perſwade the child, that it is in vain for him to ask what he wants of his father, or to wait the pleaſure of his father for it, he knows it is not. He who is led to ſeek God, to wait for God; to ſeek what his ſpirit wants of God, to wait for it from God, ſhall find that the Lord, who put him into this poſture, who keeps and ſuſtains him in this poſture, will be good unto him: And what ever jealouſies to the contrary may be whiſpered into his ears, yet they cannot enter into the inmoſt of his heart, but there is ſtill this ſecret language there, <hi>The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the Soul that ſeeketh him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>It is good that a man ſhould both hope and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which the poor creature in thraldom, in bonds, in captivity, in miſery needs is Salvation: That which the Lords Captives (thoſe that are captived at his appointment, and for his ſake) that which they need is his Salvation, even <hi>the Salvation of the Lord.</hi> There is no haſtening of this Salvation, nor no attaining any other Salvation, (<hi>They that ſeek after lying vanities, forſake their own mercies:</hi> They that turn aſide from him, after any thing but him, <hi>follow after vain things which cannot profit, for they are vain;</hi>) the beſt way is to hope and wait for it with all the quietneſs that may be. This doth beſt compoſe and temper the ſpirit in its preſent miſery, to hope that deliverance will come, and to wait, with all poſſible qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs, until it come. Well, I will be content to bear <hi>the buffetings of Satan,</hi> to lie open to <hi>all manner of enemies,</hi> to <hi>all manner of evils;</hi> to <hi>every vanity,</hi> to <hi>every temptation,</hi> to <hi>every corruption;</hi> to have <hi>no light</hi> to walk by, <hi>no life</hi> to move in me, <hi>no ſtregth</hi> for or againſt any thing: How can it be otherwiſe? I am in a ſtrange Land, in mine enemies hands, caſt off by my God for a ſeaſon; but there will come a time when he will again viſit me, when he wil viſit me with Salvation. Then ſhall I have all theſe burdens and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions removed from me: Till then, I muſt lie under them, and I will give up my neck to the yoke, and my ſhoulders to the load, till be vouchſafe to eaſe me. The eaſieſt poſture in miſery is the ſpirits ſuiting and complying with it.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Every one muſt bear the yoke. The <hi>ſon of Belial,</hi> the untamed fleſh muſt be tamed in every one by the yoke. Every one (how unruly ſoever at preſent) ſhall one day be made ſubject to the Will, Power and Law of him who hath prepared and fitted a yoke for that end. And the ſooner this ſubjection is begun, the eaſilier will it be wrought. A tender twig will be more eaſily bent. <hi>Captivity</hi> is not ſo bitter to a child, as to him who hath long taſted the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own Country, and of liberty in his Country. It is good to begin betimes to drink ones draught of miſery: It will be the ſooner over, the more eaſily ſwallowed, and work the more kindly. It will require a great deal of pains to bring them to the yoke, and to break them in the yoke, who were never acquainted with it (whoſe necks were never uſed to it) till their old age.</p>

That which men hear of the renown of God is from the mouths of his people, whoſe heart alone knoweth him, and whoſe tongue alone can declare him. But this <hi>he putteth in the duſt,</hi> covering his glory with ſhame: He knows nothing now of God, and can ſpeak nothing now of God. He abaſeth the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his praiſe <hi>(hangs his harp upon the willows,)</hi> thoſe lips that were wont to lift up the great Name of God in the world, are now layd in the duſt: <hi>He putteth his mouth in the duſt.</hi>

And this is the furtheſt they can go, and it is a great degree of life and refreſhment too: for when all light is ſhut out, that there is no ſight of Redemption or a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and the ſpirit within flags, and is ſo continually overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with waves and billows, that it hath not a moments reſpite to lift up its head, how can it go further? it is well it can go ſo far as an <hi>if.</hi> Read but a little backward, and you ſhall hear another lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:165768:63"/>
far different from this, <hi>My hope and my ſtrength is periſhed from the Lord:</hi> I may now even go ſhift for my ſelf as well as I can, but that hope, that ſtrength which I faſtened upon God for, and which I was wont to have from God, is quite loſt, the very bottom of it is failed.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>He giveth his cheek to him that ſmiteth him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He <hi>reſiſteth not evil:</hi> All his ſtrength is broken, and now he knoweth how to reſiſt no longer. He lieth open to all manner of injuries from all manner of enemies; he yeeldeth up his face to men, to Satan to buffet. Now his <hi>wiſdom</hi> is taken from him, his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is not ſo averſe from bearing <hi>oppreſſion.</hi> He wants his true fence, his proper fortreſs, which he knows is alone able to ſecure him, and ſo he ſeeks no ſhelter from any indignity, from any ſtroke of malice or cruelty, but yeelds himſelf (like Chriſt) to be led about like a fool, ſpit upon, buffeted, any thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He is filled full with reproach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no ſuch object of ſhame and obloquy, as the people of God in their Captivity. Their former height, their nearneſs to God, their intereſt in God, their boaſts about their expectations from God, all tend to fit them for and lay them open to the greater ſcorn: And the more livelily God did appear and act in them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the greater is their preſent ſhame. <hi>All that paſs by clap their hands at thee, they hiſs and wag their head at the daughter of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> What <hi>is this the City that men call the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole Earth?</hi> Is this the people that were ſo glorious, ſo eminent <hi>in piety, in purity, in ſelf-denyal, in mortification, in faith, in love, in all manner of righteouſneſs and holineſs?</hi> And his ſpirit is ſenſible of the juſt ground of this reproach that is caſt upon him; for there is not that lovelineſs that was, nay there is all manner of unlovelineſs appearing in him, now God hath left him. He is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared all over with <hi>lying among the pots,</hi> and though he be comely in this his blackneſs, yet not to any outward eye, no not to his own eye; he ſeeth not his own comelineſs, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not caſt off any of that reproach that is thrown upon him, not ſo much as from his own ſpirit, but is filled with it; <hi>he is filled full with reproach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>For the Lord will not cast off for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the ground, of all this his miſery, hinted at: God hath
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:165768:64"/>
caſt him off at preſent. When he had nothing he was made rich by Gods entertaining him, and taking care of him, who when he ſaw him <hi>in his blood</hi> pitied him, and bid him <hi>live:</hi> But now, he who clothed him, ſtrips him again naked, <hi>(naked as in the day that he was born;)</hi> he, who took him in, thruſts him out of doors; he, who gave him light, takes away his light; he, who breathed life into him, dryeth up his life; he, who redeemed him out of his enemies hand, delivereth him back into his enemies hand again: And now he is worſe then he was before, both worſe uſed by his enemies, and more ſenſible of his ſufferings and miſery in his own ſpirit. Thus it was with Chriſt; He was <hi>the Son of his Love,</hi> he in and with whom he delighted to live and converſe, his only one, in whom the pleaſure of his Soul was ſeated, whom he was continually nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, whom he delighted to ſatisfie, fill and pleaſe with himſelf, with the inhabitation, preſence and enjoyment of himſelf: But at laſt, when Chriſt had moſt need of him, then he left him; <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And thus may every one alſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of, feel and complain of it, when the time of their Captivity, when the ſeaſon, of the hour and power of darkneſs's ſeizing upon them, cometh.</p>
            <p>But <hi>the Lord will not cast off for ever:</hi> Though he doth thus caſt off, and make miſerable for a ſeaſon, yet it ſhall be but for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it ſhall not always laſt: And it is a ſecret ſenſe of this that makes him thus quietly give up himſelf unto his preſent moſt miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell,</hi> I ſhall not always lie in the grave, ſaith Chriſt; and while I lie there, that life which I would have preſerved ſhall not corrupt there: I ſhall loſe nothing by my death, by my miſery, but that which I my ſelf am willing to part with. I ſhall not loſe my God, for he will be ſtill with me in the grave (though not to my ſenſe) and will raiſe me out of the grave, and manifeſt himſelf again unto me. He will ſo appear in me, that I ſhall fear <hi>grave, death, hell, ſin, devil</hi> no more. <hi>Why</hi> then <hi>art thou ſo ſad O my Soul, and why art thou ſo diſquieted within me? Hope in God, for I ſhall yet ſee him,</hi> and ſatisfie the deſire of my heart with the ſight of him. <hi>The Lord will not caſt off for ever,</hi> nay doth not caſt off at preſent any further then I deſire to be caſt off by him. Though there is that weakneſs and tenderneſs in me (which is much encreaſed by duration of miſery) which turns
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:165768:64"/>
from the cup, and deſires if it were poſſible to avoyd it, yet there is that alſo in me which takes it willingly, and drinks it down hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſtands ready to embrace both that ſickneſs and that death (with all its ſick fits, and ſharp pangs) which it haſtens upon them who drink deeply of it.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>But though he cauſe grief, yet will he have compaſſion according to the multitude of his mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is God that <hi>cauſeth grief:</hi> He meaſureth out our ſorrow to us, as well as the miſery that cauſeth it. He drowneth the Soul in anguiſh, who thought it had been impoſſible for him to have been driven from rejoycing and delighting in himſelf. And our ſtate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it: We have as much need of the pain, of the ſmart, of the grief, as of the affliction that occaſioneth it, (<hi>if need be,</hi> yea if need be, only if need be, <hi>ye ſuffer heavineſs through many temptations,</hi> for <hi>he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men from his heart;</hi> it is <hi>his ſtrange work,</hi> not his natural delight.) He ſends into captivity, and he maketh that captivity doleful; and though we cry and roar, yet will he not hear, but ſhut up his bowels againſt us: But he will have a time again to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, he will have a time to heal and take away grief, as well as to wound and cauſe it. He hath multitude of mercies within him to heal and make up every condition of miſery with, and he will one day open the ſluces wide, and let forth all his bowels, <hi>he will have compaſſion according to the multitude of his mercies:</hi> And then <hi>he that keepeth not alive his Soul</hi> ſhall know and praiſe him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God will build up Sion,</hi> and when he builds up <hi>Sion he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his Glory:</hi> He will repair <hi>the old waste places,</hi> and ſhine himſelf in thoſe deſolate ruines: He will make <hi>the Wilderneſs a pleaſant Land,</hi> even his own garden of delight. Wiſe man could never know God, could never learn the way to God, could never be acquainted with the Life of God, that which he calls ſo is vanity: But Gods fools ſhall know him; Thoſe that are indeed ſtripped and made naked by him ſhall indeed be clothed with him; Thoſe whoſe <hi>old life, old eye, old heart</hi> is ſlain, dead and buried, ſhall be raiſed with <hi>a new life, a new eye, a new heart,</hi> and that life ſhall live in God, that eye ſee God, and that heart embrace God. This <hi>feed,</hi> which hath ſo long layn dead in the grave, when it is raiſed by that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:165768:65"/>
Almighty Power which ſlew it, ſhall <hi>love the Lord its God with all its heart, and live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, <hi>Say not, O Jacob, nor complain not, O Iſrael, ſaying, My way is hid from the Lord,</hi> (God takes no notice of what befalls me,) <hi>My Judgment</hi> (that Salvation which God himſelf hath judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuitable to my condition) <hi>is paſſed over by my God:</hi> for he will ſhew himſelf as skilful to vent his mercies and compaſſions (which all miſeries tend to ſtir) as he hath been to cauſe grief. As he hath been exceeding skilful in making ſuch a wound in thee as none can adminiſter any thing to heal or mitigate the ſmart of, ſo he will likewiſe approve his skill in providing balm him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and in applying it to effect a perfect cure. None could grieve thee but he, none could touch thy life but he; he hath touched thy life to purpoſe, ſo as thou never ſuſpectedſt: None can refreſh thee, none can reſtore thee but he; ſtay, wait, ſee what he will do, and if he do not ſatisfie thee with life and Salvation, ſpare not to blame him.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>BAbylon</hi> is the chief fabrick, the great maſter-peece of the ſpirit of man, the City that man buildeth to dwell with God in, to enjoy God in, yea <hi>the great City,</hi> which all the will, wiſdom and power of man have contributed towards to the utmoſt, to make it glorious and ſumptuous, to make it pleaſing to, and taking with the ſpirit of man. The City that God builds is <hi>Sion,</hi> the City that man builds is <hi>Babylon.</hi> The City that God erecteth is ſpiritual, he doth it by his own Spirit, with his own ſpiritual Wiſdom: The City that man erecteth is carnal, from and according to the meaſure of his own carnal mind; That which he ſets up for the Will of God, for the Worſhip of God, is but according to his own carnal apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and imagination; That which he worſhips for God is not God, but <hi>Bell or Merodach</hi> his own Idol, an Idea which his own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath framed, which he ſees and apprehends to be God with the eye of his underſtanding, but will prove but emptineſs and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the preſence and light of the true and living Subſtance.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Babylon,</hi> in this great City there are many <hi>ſtreets,</hi> and in them many <hi>houſes,</hi> and in them many <hi>rooms</hi> of ſeveral heights or ſtories: There is much <hi>beauty,</hi> much <hi>riches,</hi> much <hi>ſweetneſs,</hi> much
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:165768:66"/>
               <hi>pleaſure:</hi> Their worſhip of their Idol is glorious; their enjoyments high, their pleaſure great, their raptures ſweet: There is ſomewhat in one ſtreet or other, in one room or other, to allure and entangle the ſpirit of man in what dreſs ſoever it be; (ſhe hath wares ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſpirit of man, be it in what ſtate or poſture it will,) and hereby ſhe prevails to draw the whole Earth after her. In <hi>Sion</hi> there's <hi>a God, a Will, a Worſhip, a Light, a Purity</hi> that will not bend one jot to humour the will or wiſdom of man in the leaſt, and therefore <hi>the ways of Sion mourn, poor Sion is deſolate:</hi> But <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> is ſuited to the wiſdom and will of man, there is ſomewhat in her to take every one with, and therefore all the trade and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique runs that way.</p>
            <p>O the beauty of <hi>Babylon!</hi> O the excellent order in <hi>Babylon</hi> to the eye of man! (the unity, the uniformity, the harmony, the decency!) <hi>Sion</hi> is a poor mean thing, not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Babylon,</hi> nay hardly worthy, to be the footſtool of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But O the filthineſs of <hi>Babylon,</hi> O the confuſion of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> to the eye and in the light of God! and O how beautiful is <hi>Sion</hi> there!</p>
            <p>In <hi>Babylon</hi> there are two eminent things to be taken notice of.</p>
            <p>There's their own <hi>Image,</hi> their own <hi>way,</hi> their own <hi>worſhip,</hi> their own <hi>knowledg,</hi> their own <hi>light</hi> adorned, beautified, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as very taking, and enforced upon all; all muſt acknowledg and do reverence to this <hi>Image</hi> ſome way or other: They muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in ſome ſtreet, in ſome houſe, in ſome room, though not all in one and the ſame.</p>
            <p>And then there's <hi>the holy Seed, and the veſſels of the Houſe of the Lord</hi> in Captivity; <hi>the true Life, the true Power</hi> is hampered and kept under there: The people of God lie there <hi>among the pots,</hi> defiled, beſmeared, made ſlaves, and put to nothing but drudgery in the Land of their enemies. No lovelineſs appears in them, but all the glory ſhines in and about <hi>Babylons</hi> brood: They appear poor and wretched; the rich ones, the great ones are the children of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon. Sion</hi> mourns, pants, fetches breath for life, is <hi>deſtitute, afflicted, tormented: Babylon</hi> hath <hi>pleaſure, lives deliciouſly;</hi> lightſomneſs is in her countenance, and ſorrow far from her heart, <hi>I fit as a Queen,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>and ſhall never ſee widowhood.</hi> The
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:165768:66"/>
               <hi>Babylonians,</hi> they have a glorious God and a glorious Worſhip, all things magnificent: But Gods people they are like <hi>loſt ſheep, like ſheep turned away upon the mountains,</hi> like ſheep running aſtray, having none to take care of them; God doth not look after them now ſo as he did while they were in their own Land, nor do they know how to find out their God, but wander up and down <hi>from mountain to hill, having forgotten their resting place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> there will be the Redemption, the reſcue, the delivery of this Seed; the defacing of all her glory, the diſcovery of her paint, and the lothſomneſs of that underneath, which ſhe thus painted, and the clothing of <hi>Sion</hi> with Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, with true Beauty and Glory. She <hi>(Babylon)</hi> ſhall have torment in ſtead of pleaſure, <hi>(How much ſhe hath glorified her ſelf and lived deliciouſly, ſo much torment and ſorrow give her. The voyce of the Bridegroom and of the Bride ſhall be heard no more at all in thee.)</hi> Darkneſs in ſtead of light, <hi>(The light of a candle ſhall ſhine no more at all in thee.)</hi> Howling in ſtead of muſick, <hi>(The voyce of Harpers, Muſicians, &amp;c. ſhall be heard no more at all in thee.)</hi> Deſolation in ſtead of ſuch abundant traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, <hi>(No Craftſ-man, of whatſoever craft he be, ſhall be found any more in thee: and the ſound of a milſtone ſhall be heard no more at all in thee.)</hi> Filthy nakedneſs in ſtead of precious garments and ornaments, for ſhe was <hi>clothed in fine linnen, and purple, and ſcarlet; and decked with gold, and precious ſtones, and pearls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The plagues and downfall of <hi>Babylon</hi> (they may be put together, for her plagues ſhall quickly make an end of her) ſhall be ſudden, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, and utterly deſtructive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sudden,</hi> like the taking up of a ſtone, and throwing it into the Sea; her plagues come <hi>in one day,</hi> Verſ. 8. (<hi>death, mourning, famine,</hi> yea <hi>utter burning,</hi>) nay <hi>in one hour,</hi> Verſ. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Violent, Thus with violence ſhall that great City Babylon be thrown down;</hi> beſides its own weight, which will make it deſcend downward amain, there is the ſtrength of him that caſts it added to it, and it is <hi>a mighty Angel,</hi> who is choſen out to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>And <hi>utterly destructive,</hi> ſhe ſhall be ſo ſunk that ſhe <hi>ſhall be

found no more. Sion,</hi> though long drowned and loſt in <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſhall be fought out and found again, <hi>her Land ſhall be married;</hi> though ſhe fall, ſhe ſhall riſe again; though her light be put out, and ſhe ſit long in the dark ſighing and mourning over her widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and deſolation, yet her Sun ſhall riſe again, light ſhall ſpring unto her out of obſcurity: But <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be utterly deſtroyed, eternally deſtroyed, ſhall be put to ſuch a death as it ſhall never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover from, ſhall be buried in that Sea where nothing can never be found more that is caſt into it; <hi>and ſhall be found no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this manner ſhall <hi>Babylon</hi> be deſtroyed. It ſhall not only be raſed to the ground, but it ſhall be plucked up by the very roots: God will not only cut off ſome branches of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and caſt them into the fire, but he will lay the Ax to the root of the tree, and caſt the whole tree with all its branches, leaves, fruit, trunk, root and all into that fire which ſhall prevail over it utterly to conſume it. <hi>Sion ſhall be purified with Judgment,</hi> but <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed with Judgment: <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall be purged by the fire, but <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be burnt to nothing in the fire; This droſs the fire will lick up for ever, and ſuffer to be or appear no more.</p>

of this impreſſion, muſt live for ever: yet its life may be driven back exceedingly inward, and it deprived of all the ſenſe and ſweetneſs of life or refreſhment by life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Coming of the Lord.</hi> Here he tells them how long their patience ſhould laſt, namely until the Lord come; then they ſhall wait no longer, then they ſhall hope no longer, then they ſhall deſire no longer, but enjoy what they have waited for, hoped after and deſired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord.</hi> Chriſt is the Head of both Creations, he is <hi>the Lord of Life;</hi> he gave life unto both, he hath appointed every thing its courſe in life and motion, and he will call all to an account concerning every Talent that they have been entruſted with by him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Coming of the Lord.</hi> Chriſt was once here in this World in a fleſhly body like ours, cauſing the glory of the Godhead (which dwelt in his Spirit) to ſhine in it and through it as he pleaſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with men, but more eſpecially with his own, going in and out before them as the ſhepherd doth before his ſheep: He came unto the world, and he came unto his own: He made an offer of himſelf to the world, he enforced himſelf upon his own, or which is all one, made them <hi>willing</hi> to receive him <hi>in the day of his power.</hi> Now after he had thus lived a while he went away again, appeared thus no more, was to be ſeen or known thus no longer: <hi>The Comforter</hi> was to come to ſuſtain their hearts until the coming of Chriſt again, but Chriſt himſelf was to be ſeen no more, until his return from that far Country into which he then went, when he took his leave of his deareſt ones. The Seed of God they are the Spouſe of Chriſt, and their life conſiſts in the preſence of their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: If they might have the Spirit of God dwelling in them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo fully, it will not ſerve their turn, they muſt have Chriſts company. There is that foundation layd in the ſpiritual Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and them, that neither could enjoy God with content without the other, neither can they enjoy themſelves any where without one another: They cannot enjoy themſelves in the earth till they enjoy Chriſt there, nor can Chriſt enjoy himſelf in Heaven till he enjoys them there. Their content, their life, their happineſs is bound up in one another, and there alone can they reap and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Coming of the Lord.</hi> Chriſt is gone, removed out of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:165768:69"/>
world from the eye of fleſh, <hi>a cloud hath taken him out of our ſight:</hi> He is <hi>hid in God</hi> even where he was hid before he was manifeſted in the fleſh, and thither is he retired again, whither no eye can follow him; <hi>whither I go ye cannot come:</hi> and there muſt he ſtay the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſeaſon. But he is to come again, he will come again, he ſhall come again, <hi>He that ſhall come will come: If I go and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place, I will come again and receive you unto my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two things comprized in <hi>the Coming</hi> of Chriſt, two great effects of his coming, which make it on the one hand ſo terible to ſome, and on the other hand ſo deſirable to others. There is the death of the world in it, and the life of his people. He will come <hi>to Judgment,</hi> to reveal, declare and execute Judgment: And this is the Judgment, which he hath already pronounced (though not in the ſame way as then he will, he hath but talked of it yet, but then he will make good what he hath hitherto held out but in words) <hi>viz. Death to the old earthly man,</hi> he will ſtrike him at the very root, and in all his branches and fruit, wo to every thing that hath ſprung from him, wo to him in every thing wherein he hath appeared and acted, <hi>Life to the new ſpiritual man;</hi> Deſtruction to <hi>Babylon, everlasting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;</hi> Salvation to <hi>Sion, everlasting Salvation: Your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence, he will come and ſave you.</hi> He will come <hi>with gloomineſs with darkneſs</hi> over-ſpreading all the light of the Creature, but he will come with <hi>the light of life</hi> to you: <hi>Becauſe he lives, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> He will cover all the glory of the Creature with ſhame, but he will cloath you with glory. <hi>It doth not yet appear what we ſhall be, but when he appears we ſhall appear with him</hi> in the ſame glory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he himſelf appears. His abſence is your death, your miſery, your torment; but it is the joy, happineſs and life of the world; they cannot live nor enjoy any thing, nor rejoyce in any thing in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. <hi>Ye ſhall weep and lament, but the world ſhall rejoyce:</hi> why? what is the matter? O! very great cauſe for both. Chriſt hath left the Earth, and now the men of the Earth can enjoy their life ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quietly; that which diſturbed, that which interrupted their joy, their life, their peace, is removed: But it was that which fed the life of his people, therfore they weep and mourn. But ſaith Chriſt, chear up your ſpirits poor hearts, your grief and ſadneſs ſhall have a better iſſue then their mirth and jollity; your ſeed-time (though it
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:165768:69"/>
be very troubleſom and boyſterous, though ye <hi>ſow in tears</hi> and deep anguiſh of ſpirit) is better then their harveſt: your ſorrow ſhall be turned into joy, when their joy ſhall be turned into ſorrow: I will turn the ſcales one of theſe days, <hi>I will ſee you again and your heart ſhall rejoyce, and your joy none taketh from you.</hi> O how will the heart of the People of Chriſt leap at the ſight of Chriſt who is their full and onely joy! And if he remain always with them, as he then will, their joy can never be taken from them more. Be quiet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>be patient;</hi> wait but till this time, till the Lord come, and you will finde amends made for all your miſery. Then ye are to have your happineſs, then ye are to reap and enjoy, and ye ſhall reap and enjoy that which will give you full content, if ye can but ſtay your time. But before the coming of the Lord expect it not; If in the mean time ye may have but ſo much of the Spirit allowed you, as may help you to rub on, as may keep you from ſinking under your burdens and miſeries, it is well: but as for any enjoying of life or ſweetneſs it is not till then to be had.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be patient therefore. Therefore.</hi> Becauſe your happineſs, your life, your content will be ſo compleat, ſo full and ſatisfactory then; becauſe ye ſhall be ſo full of joy, ſo abound with true riches, when they who have hitherto been rich ſhall mourn over the loſs of all: when the world ſhal loſe all their life, all their ſubſtance, all their hope, all their joy; then ſhall ye enter into the poſſeſſion of yours, which ſhall be as full &amp; as laſting as your hearts can deſire. <hi>Be patient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;</hi> Be content to be without it a while and to feel miſery and anguiſh under the ſenſe of the want of it: <hi>ye now therefore have ſorrow,</hi> ye muſt <hi>ſow in tears</hi> before ye reap in joy; and be content to do ſo, to go forth weeping to ſow your <hi>precious ſeed,</hi> and ſtay for your crop till the harveſt, it will be worth your ſtaying for: <hi>Be patient therefore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold the Huſbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the Earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.</hi> Ye ſee it ordinary in the courſe of Nature; Precious things take time to grow, and the Husbandman doth not expect to reap ſo ſoon as he hath ſowed, but waits the ſeaſon, waits for the former rain, and after that waits again for the latter. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven</hi> is like ſeed ſown, which muſt have ſeaſons paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it before it ſpring up, muſt rot and dye before it live (though in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:165768:70"/>
its rotting it doth not rot, and in its dying it doth not dye) and when it doth ſpring up, muſt grow gradually and undergo many changes before it cometh to maturity.</p>
            <p>There is a double ſowing, one of Chriſts, another of ours: Chriſt ſoweth, and we ſow. Chriſt ſoweth in us, and we ſow unto him: He ſows the ſeed of life in us, and this life in us ſows the ſeed of living motions towards him, and of living operations in him; it moves ſpiritually towards Chriſt, it works ſpiritually in Chriſt. Every motion of life, put forth towards Chriſt, is a ſowing; Every act of faith, of love, of joy, of expectation, of contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſubmiſſion of ſpirit under his diſpoſe, is a ſowing; <hi>He that ſoweth unto the fleſh ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption, but he that ſoweth unto the ſpirit ſhall of the ſpirit reap life everlasting:</hi> To be ſpiritual, to move ſpiritually, to live ſpiritually, is to ſow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſpirit; as to be carnal, to move carnally, to live carnally, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will and deſire of the fleſh, is to ſow unto the fleſh. Now all theſe, all theſe motions, all theſe operations, this life with all the buddings forth of it muſt be thrown into the Earth, dye there, be gone and loſt a long ſeaſon before they come to any thing, ſo that the fleſh which had great hopes becauſe of them, great delight in them, and great deſire after them, will loſe all its expectation, be weary of its delight, and let fall its deſire, and will be vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwading the ſpirit to do ſo alſo. To what purpoſe is it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve? to what purpoſe is it to pray? to what purpoſe is it to deny ones ſelf, and to ſuffer in ſo many kindes? All comes to nothing, he whoſe ſpirit multiplyeth in theſe, multiplyeth ſorrow unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, &amp;c. True, all theſe are thrown into the Earth, loſt and gone for ever to all ſight and appearance, they come to nothing, a great deal of pains and trouble there is, but to no purpoſe: And how can it be otherwiſe, ſeeing the time of reaping, nay perhaps of growth, is not yet come? But wait, run the venture, as you ſee the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is fain to do who expects a crop.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be ye alſo patient.</hi> Follow their example, wait and wait long as ye ſee they do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stabliſh your hearts.</hi> Do not give way to frights, to diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from preſent preſſures, which may diſhearten you and make your waiting irkſom; but <hi>ſtabliſh your hearts</hi> to wait. It will come, it will be worth all your waiting for it when it comes, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:165768:70"/>
the longer it ſtays the more weighty will it be in it ſelf and the ſweeter to you: Be content then to ſtay for it, and to expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but trouble and miſery until you meet with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the Coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a great encouragement to wait, if one be neer the attaining of what one waits for: And this great advantage Faith hath always had to repreſent things very neer, as neer as they can be deſired to be. <hi>The Coming of the Lord</hi> is a great way off to the eye of man (ſo far off that he can hardly forbear ſcoffing at the ſpiritual man for ſpeaking of it as nigh at hand) but cloſe by to the eye of Faith, even as near as Faith would have it. Faith would have nothing wrought otherwiſe then it is (he that ſees every thing with a ſpiritual eye can diſlike nothing) it would not have any thing come ſooner then it is appointed to come. It is the fleſh, which ſhall never be ſaved, that is ſo haſty after Salvation, but <hi>he that beleeveth doth not make haſte,</hi> but ſtayeth willingly till Salvation be ripe, and till he be ripened for Salvation. It is the fooliſh fleſh that thinks it ſelf wiſe enough to cut out its own ſeaſon and proportion of deliverance, but the truly and ſpiritually-wiſe-childe knoweth his degree of wiſdom (the degree of wiſdom allotted him) doth not amount high enough for this undertaking, and therefore yeeldeth it up to the diſpoſe of the wiſdom of the Father. The fleſh is much troubled that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have things, times and ſeaſons at its own diſpoſe: the ſpirit (or ſpiritual childe) would not have them at its own diſpoſe if it might. The ſpirit, in the ſpirit of the childe, teacheth it contentedly (from choyce and with delight) to give up it ſelf to the diſpoſe of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the ſpirit of the Father. Surely it cannot but ſeem ſtrange to the eye of man that the Apoſtles ſhould then, in their times, ſo many ages ago, ſpeak of the coming of Chriſt as ſo nigh, and that it ſhould yet be ſo far off; but Faith can digeſt very well. Faith ſees the certainty of it, the ſuddenneſs of it, yea that it is already in motion; <hi>Behold he that cometh, will come, and will not tarry.</hi> He is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a coming, and he will come on, he will not ſtay. <hi>He comes, he comes;</hi> he wo'nt ſtep back again, he will come on forward, nay he wo'nt ſtand ſtill, he will not tarry. <hi>Behold he cometh leaping over the mountains, skipping over the hills: Ariſe, ſhine, thy light is come: Lift up your heads, your Redemption draweth nigh.</hi> Howl ye who have thriven and grown rich in his abſence; your delight,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:165768:71"/>
your content, your life, your peace, your happineſs is ended, your Sun is ſet: Spring forth with joy and ſinging ye weak, ye ſick, ye poor, faint, diſtreſſed ſpirits; <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs is riſen with healing in his wings,</hi> he is coming to anoint you with <hi>the oyl of ſalvation and gladneſs, to wipe away all tears from your eyes,</hi> and ſo to fill you with joy as ye ſhall be able to grieve or weep no more. <hi>He will appear the ſecond time without ſin to Salvation:</hi> ye have been long talking of Salvation, when he cometh again ye ſhall know what it meaneth, ye ſhall feel what it is; and it will not be long ere he come, he is upon his march already, haſtening towards you, coming on apace, the appointed time of his abſence is wearing out amain, and the time of his return approaching, <hi>The day is at hand, the Coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</hi> Even ſo Amen; <hi>Come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly,</hi> redeem the time of thy long delay, and <hi>come quickly,</hi> yea very quickly. <hi>The Spirit of the Bride ſaith Come, and he that is athirſt ſaith Come; Come O Water of Life or I periſh, come O Bread of Life or I famiſh. Come, Come.</hi>
