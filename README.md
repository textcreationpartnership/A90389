1. Of the Fathers care over this Childe, and his readineſs to provide for him every thing he needs, FROMLUK. 11. Verſ. 13.If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your Children: how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?

1. A ſtrange Occurrence, which may befall this Darling of God and of Chriſt, in his pilgrimage and travel towards his native Country, hidden in a Parable, JOHN Chap. 11.

1. Of the Relation between Chriſt and his, and the Hold they have of each other; FROMJOH. 10. Verſ. 14.I am the good Shepherd, and know my ſheep, and am known of mine.

1. Of the New Covenant: FROMHEBR. 8.10, 11, 12.For this is the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord: I will put my Laws into their minde, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a People.And they ſhall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord: For all ſhall know me, from the leaſt to the greateſt.For I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and their iniquities will I remember no more.

1. The way to Life, which is through the death of that which we account and preſs after as life, and through the captivity of the Life it ſelf; FROM2 COR. 12.7, 8, 9, 10.And leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn to the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buffet me, leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure.For this thing I beſought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.And he ſaid unto me, My grace is ſufficient for thee; for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs. Moſt gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me.Therefore I take pleaſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake: for when I am weak, then am I ſtrong.

1. The Way to true Knowledg. FROM2 COR. 5.16.Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the fleſh: yea, though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.

ECCLES. 3. Verſ. 1, &c.To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe under the Heaven.A time to be born, and a time to dye: a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.A time to kill, and a time to heal: a time to break down, and a time to build up.A time to weep, and a time to laugh: a time to mourn, and a time to dance.A time to caſt away ſtones, and a time to gather ſtones together: a time to embrace, and a time to be far from embracing.A time to get, and a time loſe: a time to keep, and a time to cast away.A time to rent, and a time to ſow: a time to keep ſilence, and a time to ſpeak.A time to love, and a time to hate: a time of war, and a time of peace.What profit hath he that worketh, in that wherein he laboreth?I have ſeen the travel which God hath given to the ſons of men to be exerciſed therein.He hath made every thing beautiful in his time; alſo he hath ſet the World in their heart, ſo that no man can find out the Work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.

1. The ſecret, hidden, moſt inward Voyce and Demeanor of Sion, in the time of her Captivity; FROMLAMENT. 3. Verſ. 24, &c.The Lord is my Portion, ſaith my Soul, therefore will I hope in him.The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the Soul that ſeeketh him.It is good that a man ſhould both hope and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord.It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.He ſitteth alone and keepeth ſilence, becauſe he hath born it upon him.He putteth his mouth in the duſt, if ſo be there may be hope.He giveth his cheek to him that ſmiteth him, he is filled full with reproach.For the Lord will not caſt off for ever.But though he cauſe grief, yet will he have compaſſion according to the multitude of his mercies.

1. The Ruine, Deſtruction, and utter Deſolation of Babylon, FROMREVEL. 18. Verſ. 21.And a mighty Angel took up a ſtone like a great milſtone, and caſt it into the Sea, ſaying, Thus with violence ſhall that great City Babylon be thrown down, and ſhall be found no more at all.

1. An Exhortation to ſuch in whom the ſeed of life is ſown, to wait for the growth and happy ſucceſs of it; FROMJAMES 5. Verſ. 7, 8.Be patient therefore, Brethren, unto the coming of the Lord: behold, the huſbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the Earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.Be ye alſo patient; ſtabliſh your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.
